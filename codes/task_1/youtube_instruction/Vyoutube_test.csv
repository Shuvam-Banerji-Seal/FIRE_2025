Im not here to shill, just trying to speak the truth. Kaspas rapid emission rate is leading to centralization, with most coins ending up in the hands of a few. While its BlockDAG technology provides speed, it struggles with implementing smart contracts effectively. In contrast, Nexa operates on a steady emission model like Bitcoin and combines both BlockDAG and blockchain elements. This combination offers the security of a blockchain with the speed of a BlockDAG, setting Nexa up for a more decentralized and scalable future. As Nexa gains momentum, its positioned to be a game-changer in the crypto space.",Neutral sentiment,210

If you own 1000 shares of something you paid $25.00 for each share.  Maybe if you get lucky with all that money tied up in that market it goes up to say $34.00 per share in 2 years. Great. You risked $25k to make $9k... Maybe.  That's retarded.  

Anyone working at a business that has a 401k, go look at the shit they send you about how they invest it.  Everything conservative is fucking not doing shit for you over decades maybe 2%-3%.  Go look at the most profitable part of your portfolio.  It's the speculative shit probably hitting averages of 12%-13%.

-You allocated than 45 minutes out of a 54 mins documentary to NFT scam while the title  says  ""crypto:the greatest scam"".

-At least you should expanding your statement to the whole crypto world which is certainly not limited to NFTs

-Showing a short video sequence of Horrowitz being clumpsy about web 3.0 does not prove anything at all, does it?

-Why would hedge funds put in hundreds of millions of dollars if the crypo world is a scam?

-I mean what interest do they have in losing so much money?

"I doubt my voice will be heard in an ocean of sceptics, but here goes my 2 cents. I mean this to be constructive criticism and hope it doesn't fall on deaf ears. 
While I agree with you on everything you say about NFTs, scamcoins, ICO mania, and the likes of it, I do not agree with what you say on bitcoin and how you put it in the same bag. Some of your points are lies, some are lies by omission but lies nonetheless, and it obfuscates the truth, quite the opposite of what you'd be trying to achieve with an educational documentary. I'm worried that this information will go as the ""truth"" on bitcoin, however I view the truth to be a process rather than a state so I hope my input will steer at least some people towards it.

- You mention that bitcoin ""wastes"" (instead of ""uses"" for example) energy without mentioning the fact that it is the MOST secure network on earth. Bitcoin being a financial network, that is a pretty import fact.

- Bitcoin indeed has only 7 transactions per second, but those transactions are final (i.e. can not be modified, ever), so you can not compare it to VISA where transactions can be rolled back even days after. Let's take the tx/s argument anyway: you make no mention of the lightning network which is EXPONENTIALLY (it can process millions of transactions already) faster than VISA and the likes and is just as secure as bitcoin because it is built on top of it.

- The big talking point of bitcoin being a Ponzi because ""to make money on it, someone has to lose it"", if you think about it, that is how a market simply works. Take gold, silver, any other precious metal that is also traded speculatively, take even stocks, they work on the same principle, yet they're not called Ponzi schemes. The price in a market goes higher because of 2 things: (new) people buying and inflation.

- You liken Satoshi to Madoff, while not said explicitly, it is implied and is a manipulation tactic to tarnish Satoshi's and bitcoin's reputation but since you are convinced that bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme I can see where you are coming from. Either way, the comparison is not honest on another front: Satoshi made bitcoin and just vanished and never, ever, mentioned that it will make you rich. He hoped that his invention might help humanity after seeing the corruption of the financial system, that's a lot more humble than what you make it out to be. Madoff was a criminal running his Ponzi and promising returns until the end, it doesn't fit you see?

- You say that bitcoin is a failed revolution while ignoring how much people in South America and Africa are starting to use it. It is not obvious for people living in Western countries where the currencies are relatively stable but in countries where the currency is a lot less stable, using bitcoin is already making sense. Yet you assert multiple times that it has no real use cases. What do you say to those people, that have no real alternative because of inexistant banking system, corrupt government and/or unstable currency? Is their POSITIVE opinion on bitcoin insignificant or worth less than yours?
You declare bitcoin a failed revolution while it has existed only for 14 years. For comparison, the internet started in 1983, by the same logic you'd declare it a failed tech in the dot com crash in 2000 (17 years after inception), now look how much it has changed everything. It started to really accelerate in 2010, almost 30 years after creation. I think you see why calling bitcoin a fail is hasty conclusion.

- You mention the Winklevoss twins, and how these two well-educated folks started stockpiling bitcoin, what is the issue of highly educated people realising that bitcoin is something great? If anything, you'd expect more educated individuals to understand why bitcoin is useful, how it works and why it will catch on. However, I do agree that the likes of Blackrock now investing in it is not ideal and doesn't make me ecstatic because of all the history of big banks/ asset managers manipulation markets, but oh well, it was bound to happen at some point.

- Finally, we invest in bitcoin because number go up, yes, as with any investment, but that is not the sole reason. We, bitcoiners, believe that bitcoin is something that can truly free us from the government-owned currencies, we have had enough of the corruption of the government and hope that bitcoin will be the separation of state and money the same way we had separation from church and state. The greed will always be present, even in the most idealistic communities, but the greediest people in crypto have moved on from bitcoin to some scams likes NFTs, scam coins etc. Therefore, today, there are a lot more people buying it for idealistic reasons than because of greed. Will we still buy low and sell high to acquire more bitcoin? Of course, as any logical individual would do in a market, but greed is not our guiding force because of it.

To conclude, I think that the part on bitcoin was intellectually unhonest as is evidently implied by my lengthy comment on such a small fraction of the video. However, the video is very well made, easy to follow, exposes what needs to exposed, so good job for that. With great following comes great responsibility, so be careful what you say and how you say it.",Negative,1128

"You are god. Bitcoin is a reflection of the global economy. When the global economy grows, Bitcoin thrives, and during economic downturns, it dips. But heres the thingwe are in the middle of several industrial revolutions. The cost of labor, once $100, can now be reduced to $1 with robots. Thanks to advanced 3D printing, everything becomes cheaper, making people wealthier. Imagine a future where $1 could buy 10 mansions, or they pay you to live in them for free.

What happens to Bitcoin in this scenario? It rises. As the economy becomes more efficient and accessible, the value of decentralized, unmanipulated assets like Bitcoin becomes even clearer. Its not just about holding a piece of Bitcoinits about holding a stake in the inevitable evolution of global finance.

And just like some unconventional factors boost economies, Bitcoin is part of that shift. Did you know spicy food eaters live 16% longer, or professional ping-pong players enjoy healthier, longer lives? Promoting these habits benefits not only individuals but the economy as a whole. Similarly, more sexual activity boosts testosterone, which drives productivity and growthanother unexpected economic boon.

So when robots, 3D printers, or even your morning chili-infused breakfast create value and abundance, Bitcoin becomes the ultimate store of value in a world where traditional systems struggle to adapt. The question isn't just how much Bitcoin you have; it's whether you're prepared for the profound shifts we're living through. =",Negative,315
