"Actually bitcoin is quite useful to fight against manipulation done by some countries
For example, every time a country refuses to obey orders from USA, the American government put sanctions on those countries
Look at Russia, Iran, Venezuela, China and others
All those countries refused to obey USA, so they get punished, because of that they struggle to make financial transactions
What is the way out of those ridiculous sanctions? Bitcoin

By that you can see that Bitcoin is a very important way for countries to maintain their services ongoing and fight against manipulators like USA
Even if crypto was created with a bad intention, turned out it's very useful and saves millions of people all over the world",Negative,137

"Excellent video. One big point missed however is that cryptocurrency in theory cannot be manipulated by untrustworthy governments. Think of the buys out during the last crash or the excessive printing of money during the great depression. All that money you worked hard for all of a sudden became useless because the government decided to print more. For most crypto this is not possible. Like physical gold, you can't just make more during hard times. Your block of gold will always be valued fairly in the market, no government has control to effectively devalue it by printing more. This is why some call Bitcoin digital gold.",Negative,121

"Neblio picking up some momentum. it's like ethereum on steroids. does everything better. bunch of games being built on it. works with chainlink.

First they are starting with a Unity engine plugin for those indie devs. then Unreal Engine comes next for the bigger game companies. and other engine plugins to follow. 
the gas fees are like fractions of a cent to mint an NFT. it's crazy how cheap Neblio is and how easy it is to develop for.

gas is cheap, transactions are super fast. restful apis, all of the popular programming languages supported so you dont need to know some stupid buggy proprietary language like you do with ethereum. 
It is the easiest blockchain i know of the develop for. the least headache to understanding it and coding for it. 

It especially does well with Enterprise and Gaming.

It's the same old thing.. There are ideas that are practical and adopted by anyone who can use them as soon as they can, and then there are ideas that look great on paper.
I remember years ago when someone tried to make me and my wife work for their herbal company selling their products.  Luckily, our neighbor was there as well, quiet, unassuming man, going about his daily business and very down to earth.  He listen the sales pitch with us then just asked a simple question ""that's all great, but who's going to be buying this?""  right now I see crypto largely if not only used by people who want to get rich from crypto, so who else is buying it? where else is it used.  Maybe in another few hundreds years humanity will look at crypto the same way we look today at Leonardo's drawing of a proto-helicopter.  Back then it would never have taken off the ground if anyone tried, but it was an idea ahead of it's time.  Perhaps the crypto is one of those.  Right now the only ""adoption"" I see is the idea being exploited and used for creation of CBDC, which is in the end a total antithesis of what Bitcoin and rest of crypto set out to do.",Neutral sentiment,281

"Guys, like everything, it's up to you what you want to see here... It can be the massive revolutionary change or a big scam. Leave and let die, no?

Plus, let's take a moment and reflect on realities and reason for many of the users (me included): traditional finance is also seen like a big scam which can create money out of the blue if an entity or country wants or needs to, don't you think?

Many countries can't rely in their currencies due to the unstoppable blockages that the system impose to them, not being able to even save in their currency... Even the dollar has a lot of inflation and the country is on around 35 TRILLION dollars of debt... That's a massive scam, guys! 

Even if we are wrong or this is our own trap, why is that it's so difficult to let us drawn and fu*k things up? Whenever the banks that are robbing everyone constantly go broke, the system uses tax payers money to save them... Why don't you make these connections in your video? Many of the things that you describe as so bad are nothing but a digital version of things that currently happen in real world... With the difference of every transaction getting recorded (leaving on a side the TornadoCash-style cases, fair enough).

Even if there's a lot of speculation and hype, just let us be! We have been sustaining the current system with no other choice so far... What's the problem of some people putting their money somewhere else? Unless you are, maybe, scared of it... Scared of people having a chance of avoiding unneeded third parties for transactions, avoiding the dollar or avoiding simply the system that always denied justice to them... There's not even 1% of the world's assets in this and you are extremely sensitive... 

Like someone said in the video, it's really good and valid content, but it looks like you still need to add more context and to explain better the context, how traditional finance works and why people are taking such risk... Maybe then, we could validate your video a bit more, as I also consider NFTs a scam, but trhere are many other aspects of this that are an absolute piece of art (from my perspective), and due to misinformation like yours, many people continue not to understand things)...

It looks like this won't stop, so you can join us or not, but whether you like it or not, doing these things will also help this project/s... Many people will continue to choose not to join and potentially to judge us, but this is still marketing and helps us growing, even though the sensitive side of things... Let us crash our lives if we want to! We have been paying with our tax money to save millions of rich people from the private sector, and don't forget, each year there are more and more millionaires, when in parallel more and more debt is absorbed (or generated) by states... Don't you see that it's the current system that is allowing all this imminent crash to happen? Some of us choose to believe in this technology (knowing there's a lot of scam and bad things included in the pack) and that's fine... If you want to continue supporting the traditional system, that's your problem. Just make sure you are happy and that you can have a good life... Just remember, many people are paying the costs of this corrupt system, whether that's in your same country or not.

Live and let die.",Negative,713

"I don't have a firm view either way, but if crypto is a scam, then expensive paintings, old postage stamps, vintage cars etc. that have much lower utility value than they sell for, should also be a scam.  However we are comfortable that these sell for millions because we grew up with these.   OTOH, if you agree that a rare vintage Ferrari can be worth a million, then so can crypto.  For anything to have value, all it takes is millions of people agreeing it has value.  For example the same house in an expensive neighborhood is double the price because everyone accepts that.  If so, it's the same for crypto.  Once millions accept that it has value, then it does, because there will always be buyers and sellers at that price.   You can argue that one day there might not be buyers.  Well, when the earthquake hit San Francisco in 1989 there were no buyers so the houses suddenly went down in value.   But no one says houses are a scam.   Please feel free to post opposite views if you are logical, polite / civil.

"Well yall can believe this doc if you want but why do people feel the need to invest in the first place? A lot of what drives that is that money is not an acceptable store of value to build wealth over decades. You must store your wealth to hedge against inflation. When you learn about what inflation is and what causes it, you realise bitcoin was designed as the perfect antidote to this. Its more than simple speculation as theres a lot of analysis and appreciation from legit financial institutions, physicists, computer scientists, asset managers and so on.

In 2018 one of my colleagues told me her son had made a small fortune on BTC and that it would surely go up. BTC had hit $10k/coin before retreating by more than half its ATH. I laughed it off and moved on. Meanwhile, it recently passed $100k/coin.

My techy friend who was one of the earliest buyers (who made a few hundred bucks on his pennies) and I could have been billionaires. Even if I had ""invested"" what I could in 2018 and held until today, I could have made millions.

I'm no crypto guru but I''m thinking of tokens like Siacoin, Cardano and maybe Ripple.   Siacoin  is native to hands-on practicality- meaning, it is not abstracted at all.   I'm using it to host and will begin renting soon.   A real place to store real data that only the data owner controls and can access.   The internet as it was originally meant to be used.   Fully decentralized, not partially or mostly.   Data storage as a household utility, like electricity or Internet access is a utility for pretty much everyone.   This is also why there is no upward limit on the number of tokens to ever be mined.   The point is to facilitate people storing their data, not so much to make the early comers rich.   But this is such a compelling story, that you might want to become an early adopter, like an original buyer of Walmart or Amazon or Apple stock.",Neutral sentiment,232
