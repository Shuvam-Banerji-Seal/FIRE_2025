bro does'nt know what marketcap means. Just because something is cheap does not mean if u buy you will be rich. The market cap is highly important more than the coin price. For example PEPE (which is said in the video) right now is worth 0.00083 rs which fell like 95-96%. So congrats you lost all ur money. What you should actually be doing is checking the market cap of the coin. RIght now the marketcap right now is 4 billion dollars and its the 30th biggest coin in the world. So max to max u can get is like 3-4x return if you buy now. You cant expect it to go to 1 rs because if it hits 1rs then the total market cap of the coin will be 5.04 trillion dollars which is basically 2-3 times bigger than bitcoin aka the biggest and first crypto in the world.

To that naive guy that thinks this chain can go on forever, but in reality, as the price keeps going up, it becomes increasingly more difficult to sell it at increasingly higher prices. The only people making money with this are the wolves that know how to navigate the market short term fluctuations, buying low and quickly selling high, while the sheeps get slaughtered, doing exactly the opposite, and of course, the market creators, who dont care what Bitcoin does, as long as they can charge their transaction fees.

The comparison to Bernie Madoff is nonsensical because he was a single individual, albeit with a few co-conspirators, trying to enrich himself. Discussing one's investments is a normal part of life, whether it involves stocks, real estate, jewelry, or paintings. Could everything be a Ponzi scheme?

Person A can sell to Person B while making a profit, and Person B can then sell to Person C and also make a profit.

Other than that quarrel bravo I was truly enlightened by this video and at one point I wanted my son to research crypto investment strategies but now I have no motivation to do that seeing as at best it's a legal casino and it's it's very worst it's MLM of the worst sort.

"James confused crypto currency with digital assets, of which there are many categories. 
He also confuses real tech value and innovation - a dozens of private blockchains that have replaced legacy systems - with scammy applications and ideas.  

He misses very relevant and key pieces of information:

- web 1, 2, and 3 are very real evolutions but web3 will take quite a while and not everything can or should be decentralised (see the Blockchain Dilemma), and much will be mixed eg, blockchain gaming where a game is centralised by assets are NFTs / tokens 
- there are Bitcoin scaling layers such as Lightning Network 
- BTC uses far less energy than the traditional banking sector
- yes energy is needed but it also guarantees a level of security never before seen!
- illicit use of BTC is very small (3%) and we all know the Trillions of dollars of fiat money used for illegal activity 
- if centralised exchanges have failed (and the point at which criminals get caught trying to cash their crypto!) then what does that say about centralised systems and governance??!!
- I suggest people do a simple Google search to see the dozens of companies allowing BTC transactions

I agree:
- that price volatility of BTC is a threat to adoption 
- relationships between projects and influencers is generally an absolute disgrace and I know exactly how these work
- security is a big problem but thats a symptom of innovation relying on insecure ""web2"" infrastructure as much as web3 infrastructure",Negative,304

As rewards decrease over time, the appeal for new people to join Kaspa may also diminish. This raises the question, why even join Kaspa?

Im not here to shill, just trying to speak the truth. Kaspas rapid emission rate is leading to centralization, with most coins ending up in the hands of a few. While its BlockDAG technology provides speed, it struggles with implementing smart contracts effectively. In contrast, Nexa operates on a steady emission model like Bitcoin and combines both BlockDAG and blockchain elements. This combination offers the security of a blockchain with the speed of a BlockDAG, setting Nexa up for a more decentralized and scalable future. As Nexa gains momentum, its positioned to be a game-changer in the crypto space.",Neutral sentiment,210

Jika problem terbesarnya adalah fluktuasi harga, coba kembali ke awal2 bitcoin muncul, semua pairing berdasarkan nilai bitcoin, BUKAN STABLE COIN.

"Cryptocurrency, a subject of much debate,
Some call it the future, while others berate.
In a rhyming poem, let's unpack this grand plan,
Is it a game-changer or a world's greatest scam?

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and countless coins more,
They promised a revolution like never before.
A decentralized ledger, the blockchain's charm,
But some see it as a massive financial harm.

The enthusiasts say, it's freedom they seek,
A world without banks, where the future's not bleak.
They buy, they HODL, and they passionately preach,
That crypto's the answer, the system to breach.

But skeptics raise eyebrows, they worry and frown,
They see scams and bubbles all over town.
Ponzi schemes, hacks, and wild market swings,
Cryptos have caused some unfortunate stings.

Regulations are lacking, it's the Wild West,
Anonymity reigns, an asset for the best.
But with it come crooks, and money laundering schemes,
Leaving law enforcement chasing elusive dreams.

So, crypto, a puzzle, a riddle, a conundrum,
Some see the future, while others succumb.
The world's greatest scam or a new paradigm,
Time will tell if it's wise or a financial crime.",Negative,263

You think as a new guy how much is good amount to invest 10k bitcoin,Question,18
Do you believe in the concept of digital gold for Bitcoin?,Question,13
"Bitcoin maxis spread the misleading information that there are ~4700x more XRP than Bitcoin. While this is true (100B vs 21M), they conveniently forget to mention that there are 100 million satoshis per bitcoin and only 1 million drops per XRP. 

If you calculate the total units, you get 2.1 quadrillion satoshis vs 100 quadrillion drops, which adjusts the real ratio to ~47.62 drops per satoshis and NOT 4762X.

Now if you divide bitcoins top of $74k by the real ratio of 47.62, you get a potential XRP price of ~$1554.  Bitcoin has NO utility.

$1554 is with the whole 100Billion XRP in circulation. With only 53B circulating supply then : 74000/(53Q/2.1Q)= $2932 XRP

And before anybody says anything about the impossible market cap, explain to me how Ethereum reached $4000+ with an INFINITE potential supply.

XRPs price was CRIMINALLY SURPRESSED!

As for the MARKET CAP& Lets say 9 out of 10 asset (10 being the total supply) are sold @ $10, the market cap of  the asset is $100.  

After hearing (insert great news here), suddenly the whole world wants said asset, ask prices rise quickly to $1000 on exchanges.  

ONE asset is sold at $1000.  The market cap is now $10 000, even though only $1090 has been ACTUALLY INVESTED in the asset.  

THE MARKET CAP IS INSIGNIFICANT!  Its just a multiplication of the CURRENT price of the asset multiplied by the circulating supply.",Negative,373

"No no no no no. This is not a scam at all. Its just a clear way of understanding why money in general has value.

Some people believe that money has power, and others believe that belief has power. If you believe something has value, then it will. Money is just the accumulation of everyones beliefs. The more people that believe, the more value it has. The less people believe, the less value it has. This is exactly why some currencies loose there power of value, while others gain.

Cryptocurrency is in a sense, the most perfect set of money ghe world has ever known. Its because, (unlike goverment money) atkeast all the people of the world has full control of it, and there is nothing governments can do about it. 

Your video can be applied to all forms of currency in a sence, but you need to include the accumulated beliefs of individuals to increase the value of a certain currency and make that the foundation of your understanding of it. Then you will have a much mire clearer picture of exactly what currency and vakue if monye really is. That makes all the difference.

Its not a scam at all. Scams are designed to scam, don't do that at all. Its just a system of accumulated value. If its a scam, who looses? Fact is that the only way someone looses is if people stop believing it has value. 

It really is that simple. Its why you need a one hour documentary describing it, its because your logic is theory based, with little foundation. You're creating theories out of thin air, then your linking the theories together without a foundation and calling it circumstantial evidence that proves your right. But you are leaving out the foundation of exactly what money really is. 

Build your theories from the true foundation of what money really is and your picture will be clear. Then you can describe it with a couple of paragraphs of words like i am now.

"Help


Hello, everyone.

I find myself in a deeply challenging situation, and its incredibly hard for me to ask for help. Recently, I lost my restaurant in a devastating fire during student protests in Bangladesh. This was more than just a business; it was my dream and source of hope.

Compounding my struggles, I lost a $10,000 loan from family members who are now pressing me for repayment. I also invested in a memecoin called Cheepepe, hoping for a better future, but lost everything there too.

At just 20 years old, Im at a crossroads. I can either fight to build a life with the girl I love or give up entirely. Were working hard to manage our finances and dream of moving out of the country together, but the weight of these setbacks feels unbearable.

I know there are many scams online, and its shameful for me to ask for help. But I truly have nowhere else to turn. To prove my situation, Im willing to share my NID and any documentation you might need.

If you can find it in your heart to help, even the smallest contribution would mean the world to us. You can reach me via WhatsApp at +8801711378947 or email me at kbc.restaurant23@gmail.com. 

Here are my cryptocurrency addresses for donations:


- USDT (TRC20): TGRZdbDGGa5J8bK9ykwFt4dF99kGWU1oj8

The alternative is to keep within the traditional financial system. Banks, stocks, real estate (taking a loan for 25years) 

I still believe that bitcoin's rigid, decentralized software network will preserve its value. And as you said, it is deflationary. At the same time, all other traditional financial tools are inflationary (print as much as you govern by individuals).

"Saying that a deflationary currency is inherently wrong for transactions makes your whole argument moot in my opinion. And with Trump coming in saying he's going to put more into Bitcoin, it sounds like it's becoming a reserve currency. Even if Bitcoin is only for B2B transactions, it still has value. The fact that it's inherently deflationary means people will want to invest in it because it's an incredibly great store of value unlike anything we've ever seen, and countries can't cheat it either. This _is_ the revolution we dreamed about. And only 15 years later? To change the whole financial system? That's not a goal you'd ever imagine happening in under 100 years, yet it's happening now!

Bitcoin still has issues of not being useful for micro transactions. There's room for improvement. Lightning isn't gonna DeFi Bitcoin; in fact, it's the opposite. The great thing about Bitcoin is those improvements can be added. Just like how other alt coins have tried to solve this with a 2-currency system, Bitcoin can do something similar. There could be a micro-transaction currency that has lower fees and compute costs. How that'd be part of Bitcoin is something we'd find in the future. As soon as Bitcoin becomes more mainstream, there will eventually be a solution.

Bitcoin has no utility and those that have done proper research know this, hence why it is called crypto gold.

Now, there are a few (not many) cryptos with utility that solve REAL world problems. This means that 99% of cryptos WILL go to zero and be erased from existence.

If you think otherwise then ask world governments why they've adopted only certain cryptos into their financial tech plans for the future. These cryptos are in LEGAL documents found on the official websites of some major financial institutions.

4. Bitcoin uses lots of energy yes, but miners are now looking for cheaper solutions to lower their costs which creates innovation for cheaper energy! Michael Saylor has talked lots on this....its great idea!
5. Any asset you buy relies on someone paying a higher price, thats not unique to crypto. Remember these are NOT companies so of course there is no revenue generated. One can justify stocks because they generate profit....but thats just a way to justify it. Many things go up in price that are not companies, like old antiques sitting on your shelf at home.

I fucking dare you to compare Satoshi to the other founders of shitty crypto projects or celebrity endorsements or basically rug pulls.. you are not even worthy to talk about Satoshi when you obviously know nothing about Bitcoin.. most likely havent even read the white paper. I have no words to describe how misleading this video is, just trying to mix everything together like the Madoff scandal on Wall Street with crypto and Bitcoin... to give the appearance that Bitcoin founder Satoshi is just like Madoff and the whole thing is just a Get Rich Quick Scheme... because if that is the case then you tell me how many Bitcoins did Satoshi sell from his wallet when we were at the top of last bull run? Zero you fucking idiot. Does that look like a get rich quick scheme?? Huh? When all the bitcoins in Satoshis wallet (the very ""early investor"" as you would like to call him in your so called bitcoin get rich quick scheme) they just havent moved from that wallet in more than a decade... that would be the worst get rich quick scheme if you have to wait more than a decade to cash out. But obviously this dumbass never mentions this in his video because he knows nothing about bitcoin and Satoshi. And i could go on with all of the fallacies in this video... because seriously this guy just wants to sit comfortably in front of the camera and take advantage of his little fame and reputation to try to trash bitcoin when his knowledge and understanding has no comparison whatsoever with someone who went to MIT like Michael Saylor or someone who builds space rockets like Elon Musk... was someone as intelligent as Elon also  scammed into buying bitcoin?? Haha sure this pathetic influencer has more brains than Elon Musk or Michael Saylor.. yeah right. What is amazing though is amount os stupid people believing this kid and his very poor done research. This video is just about an angry baby whining in front of the camera that he fell for a rug pulled and lost money.. all because he didnt do a ""well reasearch"" before investing in whatever project or nft he lost money on. But to try to compare any of the scammers he talks about with Satoshi is seriously showing he doesnt understand Bitcoin whatsoever. He just made this video trashing Bitcoin because right now is a hot topic since we were just at the bottom of the bear market and he just wanted some views and monetize on them with whatever lies he could come up with. And just like he finishes his mediocre video... theres only one question left... whether in 5 years and 10 years and 20 years and 50 years bitcoin will be dead for the 400th time or if its value will be in the millions of dollars... thus making this dumbass and his video a fucking clown.

"Thank you for your videos mate.... With Trump's presidency, economic shifts are expected to be significant, especially given the current recession and the potential impact of future rate cuts. Although rate cuts might not boost inflation as hoped, they may lead banks to further restrict consumer and corporate lending, contributing to a deflationary period for various assets. This environment could result in declining stock values, retail and housing sales, and rising unemployment due to layoffs. For investors, a diversified portfolio especially with stocks and cryptocurrencies offers some protection, serving as a hedge amid volatility. Both long- and short-term trading strategies can help manage risks, providing stability as markets adjust.
