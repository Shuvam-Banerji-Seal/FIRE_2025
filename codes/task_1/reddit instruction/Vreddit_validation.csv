"the environmental case for bitcoin the environmental arguments against btc have gained alot of traction in recent months - the basic construction is that bitcoin uses alot of electricity for a low transaction throughput. i will start by saying that i have alot of issue with self proclaimed environmentalists in both their assessment of and solutions to the problem of human impact on the worlds climate / environment, but i do think it is clear that human activity is having a detrimental effect on the planet and that there are things that can (and ought to) be done to improve that situation. additionally, i will say that any changes that can reduce the environmental impact of bitcoin (or other proof of work assets) are worthwhile... i expect that these improvements are more likely to be related to ""cleaner"" electricity generation processes than changes to the btc protocol itself.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nnow, to the real question at hand - why would i believe that btc even in it is current state is a net positive for the environment? the answer here simply boils down to the nature of deflationary units of account vs. inflationary ones. world governments are currently in a dick measuring competition with each other over gdp... measured in how much useless shit gets cranked out and consumed on an annual basis. if people start drinking water and stop drinking coca-cola... well they just lost an inch. through continual debasement of fiat currency, you can ensure that no one bothers to save for the future... and consumes as much now as possible. even in this sub it is often mentioned that nobody would buy a coke with btc because the btc might be worth more tomorrow... and that is exactly the point. today... why wouldn't i buy a coke now when i know i can only buy half a coke in 4 years... this encourages the consumerist orgy to continue, don't save anything for the future, use it now before it is worth less. with btc when i look at that coke i can say... do i want 1 coke now, or 2 in 4 years (the rate of future value increase does decline as adoption increases, but due to the deflationary nature of bitcoin i am always incentivized to delay consumption as long as possible). to be clear... my coke consumption wouldn't drop to 0... but it does go way down.. i am still going to buy everything i need now (housing, food, etc.), and a few luxuries here and there... but overall, i am incentivized to consume less and entertain myself in other ways. this is good for the environment, and for human impact on the planet. why are we all rushing to buy that new iphone with an improvement in picture quality you'd need an electron microscope to observe? because why not... it is not like delaying the purchase till my old phone breaks earns me anything. with btc - this gets flipped on its head. i don't have a pile of cash losing value by the second that i am trying to dump in to anything.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\ntldr: btc uses alot of electricity and all other things being equal, that is likely not great for the environment, but btc also breaks the debt cycle manipulation and encourages people to use what they need now and save the rest for later instead of consuming everything as fast as possible which is great for the environment.",Neutral sentiment,684

"crypto is fast- here is why that matters \n\ncryptocurrency has a lot of benefits over traditional payment mechanisms. it is decentralized, and it has an algorithmically determined money supply that leads to a stable currency. those are all very important benefits, but to the everyday user, they might seem a little bit abstract. the everyday user just wants a simple, fast, effective payment mechanism to use without hassle. in this article, i wanted to take a little bit of time and discuss one of the **more tangible benefits of cryptocurrency usage for normal, everyday users - the quick payment settling speed.**\n\n**slow speeds create disagreement**\n\nwith traditional payment methods, such as credit cards, it can take anywhere from 24 hours to three days for funds to move from one person is bank account to another person is bank account. obviously, this can create confusion and disagreement if one person thinks they have paid for something but the other person has not yet received funds in their bank account.\n\nimagine for a moment that you pay for a airplane flight, hotel reservation, or bus ticket with your credit card on tuesday night. when you show up on wednesday for your hotel or flight, the business owner politely notifies you that you will need to pay them since they have not yet received anything from your account. both parties believe that they are in the right. if you paid with your credit card on a tuesday night, you could easily look at your bank account and see that you had pending charges. at the same time, the merchants would not yet have any payment received in their account. even though both parties have the best of intentions, the length of time that it takes to settle this payment can cause disagreement and cause both parties to suspect each other of wrongdoing. the merchant would think that the customer is trying to avoid paying , and the customer would think that the merchant is trying to double charge them.Â \n\n**crypto provides speed and certainty**\n\nnow, instead of paying with credit cards, let is suppose that we were paying with the usdc stablecoin or the dai stablecoin. these are both cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of $1 and are exchanged on the ethereum network. according to eth gas station, it currently takes about 19 cents to make a transfer that will process and settle in about 2 minutes. remember that the average credit card charge takes between 24 hours and 3 days to settle. even if we give credit cards the benefit of the doubt and assume that every transfer happens at the fast end of that spectrum and completes in 24 hours, that still means that transferring usdc or dai is over 720x faster.\n\nthis fast transfer speed is important because it gives both parties the confirmation that payment has been tendered and payment has also been received. perhaps even more importantly, this record of transfer is publicly available in an immutable blockchain that can be reviewed and consulted in case there is ever a discrepancy on whether somebody actually paid or not.\n\ncryptocurrency offers a whole host of benefits over traditional payment methods, but even if we discount the importance of decentralization or censorship resistance, cryptocurrency can still offer many improvements over traditional payment methods. the long delay that it takes to process pending charges via traditional credit card can be a source of confusion and disagreement between merchants and customers. the ability to conduct near-instantaneous transfers and settle payments quickly is just one more actual use case that will make crypto the money of the future.\n\n**references**\n\n[creditcardprocessing.com]( gas station]( credit\n\n[",Miscellaneous,733

"using a per transaction metric to talk about bitcoin energy use is disingenuous and intellectually lazy. here is why: the ""per transaction"" carbon, electricity and e-waste metric is such a deceitful metric. anyone who uses it is willful ignoring that: \n\n* there are several other chains that are merge mined with the same hashpower as bitcoin (syscoin is one of the biggest). so does syscoin have zero carbon responsibility because it uses btc is hash in merge mining ? the authors of such metrics would like us to believe so. \n\n* there are hundreds of thousand of transactions that take place on the lightening network. why are the authors of these ""per transaction"" metrics willfully ignoring all the activity on the lightening network ? is it because they are to lazy to actually figure out how many transactions are taking place ? or are they trying to push an agenda. besides lightening network, there are other layer 2 networks, like liquid. where thousands of transactions take place. \n\n* the current hashpower secures all past transactions. the current hashpower isnt just used to write the current transactions in a block, but its used to secure every single previous transaction in bitcoins history. \n\n* the block reward is more than just a normal transaction.\n\n the block reward can be considered as a kind of battery whereby the electricity used to make hashes is transformed into a more easily kept and stored unit. in a way, these newly created bitcoin can be considered as a form of stored electricity. the electricity used to create those bitcoins gets transformed into unit of accounts. these units then can be transformed back into electricity via purchasing power that the btc units have. or even more literally, they can be used to hire mechanical work from humans or other machines (using btc to rent a generator that produces energy, or renting a solar array to charge a battery). so figuratively the block reward acts as a sort of battery. the energy isn't ""wasted"" its merely transformed into units that can be more easily stored over time and sent across the planet. \n\nthe bitcoin energy usage discussion is a very nuanced one, and it is very intellectually lazy to try to use comparisons of ""per transaction"". lets look at gpu gaming. it uses more electricity than the bitcoin network, but it doesnt generate units of account that can be used forever (or as long the btc network exists). it just generates fun (at the time) and perhaps some fond memories. or take a look at x-mas trees lights ( they can be considered not very useful in that they only provide ascetically pleasing lights for a tiny period, yet consume the amount of energy as small countries. but again, bitcoin energy is transformed into units of account that can be used for as long as the network exists. \n\nusing a per tx metric to talk about bitcoin energy use is disingenuous and intellectually lazy. bitcoins energy use is a more nuanced conversation than just ""per transaction""",Negative,606

The country currently holds 2381 bitcoins, proving authenticity for audiences still sceptical about the coin. \n\nThe President also highlighted the fact that Bitcoin is the future of crypto and has potential in the long run.

"bitcoin vs bitcoin cash, and why bch is better in every single way i see a lot of hate towards bch which in my opinion is completely unjustified. before i get into why bch is good let me break down some common arguments against bitcoin block size being atleast 7mb.\n\n1. bitcoin is digital gold/ store of value - no, no it isn't. bitcoin was intended to replace fiat, and act as a new form of money. it was meant to allow people to buy things safely, securely, and without censorship. if you disagree, allow me to introduce you to the title of the whitepages - [bitcoin: a peer-to-peer electronic cash system]( this will lead to more centralization - this is kind of true, in the argument that this reduces miners because of lower fees, however i will argue time and time again, asic mining is where you start if you really want to argue with centralization of mining, not block size, as block size provides much more benefit to the network.\n3. larger blockchain, more centralization - storage has increased greatly in the past couple of years lessening the truth of this, and a bigger blockchain is necessary for bitcoin to be a currency, so this is an unavoidable drawback, but one that should just be accepted.\n\ni invested in crypto and joined the space out of principle, a decentralized finance system sounds better for all to me. modern day bitcoin is nothing but a shitcoin in my opinion because of its lackluster tech, inefficient network, among other things. lightning and segwit both help lighten the damage of this 1mb block size but it doesn't scale forever and each of those are considered trying to optimize around a core issue. this approach was supported by early proponent roger ver and its why bitcoin cash is much better than bitcoin is. \n\ni've also heard people say use nano for day to day and bitcoin for long term value store, but here is my question. if bitcoin is a value store that can't buy anything why should people value it? storing money in nano is better long term in that situation because atleast nano is useful while bitcoin is not. \n\nbitcoin is not scalable and nothing near a revolution, its a bloated corpse that was failed to be update and paralyzed by an anarchical maintenance. it goes against everything crypto is, and in my opinion is far more overrated when compared against eth, bch, nano, or other currencies which provide more to the table than it does.",Neutral sentiment,514

Instead of being angry and frustrated, I was wondering if there is a way to get USDT at cheaper prices. There must be some way or else how would all these P2P sellers get their USDT from. I?m pretty sure they are not selling their other cryptos at a loss to convert them into USDT. Appreciate all the help and feed back. Thank you",Question,158

"long-term investment: 150 per month, is it worth it? any advice? hi there!\n\ni'd like to start investing in cryptocurrencies in a structured way so that i can (hopefully) end up with a small amount of capital in a decade or so. my idea would be to invest 150 per month, an amount that i could risk losing if the cryptocurrency market goes ko, but that could yield more than an etf or a government bond in the long run if the market continues to grow instead.\n\ni would need your advice on how to adopt this plan, my idea is the following, which is to buy:\n\n\- 30 of ada\n\n\- 30 of eth\n\n\- 90 of btc\n\nthrough the kraken platform and move only the bitcoins in a digital wallet (blockstream green), once a year to reduce transfer fees.\n\nin your opinion is this a good idea? is there room for improvement or any further advice on how to optimize? would you change the cryptocurrencies listed above? if so, can you explain me why and what would be the best choice? \n\ni thank in advance those who can give me an answer and i apologize for any grammatical errors but english is not my native language.\n\ntldr: investing 150 per month in the long run (30 ada, 30 eth, 90 btc), is it worth it?",Question,291

"social skills 101 for crypto bros saw a question on askmen subreddit ""what is the male version of astrology girl?"" and to no one is surprise crypto dude is one of the top answers.\n\nlet is be real here, we people who are into crypto have a bad reputation socially. we are at best socially inept, at worst cult-like. the stereotype of the crypto bros is one who tries to 'teach' them about crypto, and get them to convert their hard earned money to the sacred crypto. i have been on dates and the moment i talk about crypto, i can literal feel her pants tighten up, and help her remember that she has something important came up and need to end the date early.\n\nto help with dispelling this negative image of crypto bros, i decided to write up this post on how to improve our social skills with people.\n\nthe fundamental issue with crypto bros is basing his entire identity around crypto itself. to be fair, basing one is identity to a single thing, like religion, politics, work etc. is a horrible idea. life is a lot more than just crypto; have some fun hobbies, be proactive in your professional career, be involved in friends and families' lives. i get that you're passionate about crypto and how it will change your life, that doesn't mean you have to shove it down into other people is throat. it is like that annoying christian dude that won't shut up about jesus and somehow connecting every conversational topic to him.\n\ni am not advocating for people to actively hide the fact that they're into crypto, if it comes out in a conversation, it comes out. there is a huge difference in responding to the question ""what are you into?"" with ""i'm really into my job (or ""working towards my dream job"" if you hate your job), i'm into (some hobby), and like to trade some crypto on the side."" vs ""oh i'm really into crypto!"" followed by a 1 hour lecture on crypto. what i'm saying is that it is important to be a well-rounded person and not basing your entire identity on crypto alone.\n\nan unhealthy mentality crypto bros have is what i call the 'red pill' mentality, where they feel superior just because they're into crypto and the person they're talking to isn't. this same mentality is also commonly found in cults, conspiracy nuts and anti-vaxxers.\n\nanother important thing, read their body language. if when talking about crypto and you can see they're no longer attentive like looking away or just looking dead in the eye, change the topic. this applies to any conversational topic. if they're not into what you're into, that is ok. if they're interested in crypto, naturally they'll ask you more about it.\n\nremember a social interaction is a two-way street, where you share about what you're into, they share theirs, and establishing commonalities. it is not you shoving down your isuperior' crypto ways into their throats.",Question,635

"why bitcoin might fall? \n\ni've recently really got into crypto. however, there are some concerns about bitcoin that i have that i cant knock back.\n\n\nfirstly, i noticed that many believe that bitcoin could replace our financial system. my issue with this is that wouldn't there be issues in the allocation of money to people? with no central governance how would governments supply those who require benefits? how could they supply funds to new businesses or gov backed developments? wouldn't wealth stay firmly stuck with the few - a problem that admittedly still exists with normal money, but surely the problem is accentuated by bitcoin?\n\n\nsecondly, i've seen many arguments about the intrinsic value of bitcoin. realistically, from my understanding the tech for bitcoin is clunky compared to other cryptos, the limit of 7 transactions a second will surely hinder its use as a global currency? furthermore, as a store of wealth is it that favourable? gold for example is scarce and has real world use, electronics and fashion. unfortunately you can't wear a bitcoin.\n\n\ni do actually believe cryptos can be a store of wealth, but fundamentally they also need to have real utility so they have something to fall back onto. with bitcoin, surely the only incentive to own bitcoin at the moment is so you can sell it on to somebody else for the same amount or more money?\n\nwouldn't a coin like erg be a better store of value? it has real utility and is scarce and can be redistributed if not moved about after a certain time period ( preventing money being lost ). and yes lol, kind of a shameless plug bc i've invested in erg. but i'm more interested in what people think about my questions and if i'm correct in thinking that something like erg is actually a better store of wealth.\n\n",Question,374

"the bitcoin maximalist perspective for non-maxis - a metered perspective. please read before commenting. **forenote:** i'm going to try to make this as short as possible while trying to be objective. bitcoin is the lion is share of my portfolio. i also own eth and a few other l2s (like matic, bsc, avax, etc.) and i also own an ens nft (because it is easier to send someone crypto if you just send it to sgtslaughtertv.eth as opposed to needing to remember 0x2134987dkjfgh123...) - i, personally, am a maximalist of useful protocols. there is also a demand to access something similar to the dollar (stablecoins) which can't be confiscated, which is why i own these l2s and eth. \n\nthere are 20,000 cryptocurrencies that exist right now. at least 98% of them are garbage. if you are in a situation where you can spare a bit of cash at the end of each month to stack sats, then you are essentially hedging against inflation using an asset that cannot be manipulated by its creator. i have nothing bad to say about vitalik or hoskinson or cz, but worshipping the idols of crypto isn't a good idea. eventually they say or do something that the media portrays in a bad light. just read the *cryptonauts* book if you don't believe me. \n\nbeing told to ""abandon"" your obscure altcoins, obviously is not a very comforting thing to hear, but bitcoin is one of the least volatile assets to hold in the ""crypto"" space right now (besides, maybe, perhaps eth, i haven't researched eth price action and volatility lately). \n\n**finally, from the perspective of bitcoin maximalists, they want people to take bitcoin seriously, and every time something bad happens like with luna or celsius they see it as harmful to bitcoin being taken seriously** and sometimes it can seem to be worse than 1 step forward and two steps back. hey sorry to interrupt, but i wanna make sure you actually read what i'm writing, so tell me what 4+9 is when you leave a comment here. \n\ni could see some narrative-shifting taking place if ethereum is market cap were to one day flip bitcoin is and then stay above it for a prolonged period of time (say a few months or a few years). people starting calling eth digital oil years ago while people called bitcoin digital gold as long as a decade ago. if you check oil'd present market cap vs. gold is then it is a no-brainer that there is more demand for oil. \n\ndiscuss!",Neutral sentiment,561

"the two things holding back crypto prices right now: 1. over-leverage, 2. unrealistic expectations so people keep wondering ""wen lambo?"" at this rate? maybe never.\n\nthe majority of the reason we expect crypto prices to increase exponentially over time is because of increased demand meeting increasing scarcity. prices will go up because of one or the other, but it takes both to increase exponentially.\n\n**1. over-leverage.** the get-rich quick crowd. if you're a big player who wants to buy a whole lot of crypto without paying a whole lot of money, how do you do it? you find the over-leveraged folks, liquidate them, and then buy up all their coins. over-leveraged long? let is short the market a little and see what shakes out. over-leveraged shorts? let is bid up the price juuuuust enough to liquidate them and then buy up all their coins too as the increased supply drops prices back down.\n\nas long as there are enough people who are just begging to be liquidated by over-leveraging, you never have to bid up the price to buy those next 1,000 btc. people are lining up to give them to you at or relatively near the current price. all you have to do is just be patient and wait.\n\n**2. unrealistic expectations.** when you look at the current coins being sold today, the majority of them have been bought within the last three to six months. analytics show that hodlers are still hodling. it is not them selling. it is the fomo crowd for the most part which is giving up these coins after a couple of months. so they either bought it with a super short time horizon and unrealistically expecting it to moon immediately, or they intended to hold it long term but invested more than they could afford with the unrealistic expectation that it would moon immediately. either way, they're providing a steady flow of crypto into whale hands.\n\nso long as we have enough people from these two categories to keep supplying people with cheap crypto, that is all we're likely to ever have: cheap crypto.",Negative,443

"what is monero and why it is key on reaching absolute anonymity and privacy on crypto \n\n\#what is monero (xmr)?\n\nmonero is just like every other crypto which makes it digital currency. the main difference between monero and every other cryptocurrency is the fact that monero is fungible and can't be linked to any user or identity. the term fungible refers to a currency where every unit is identical and mutually interchangeable with another unit of the same value. so bitcoin received from the illegal transaction can be distinguished from a bitcoin bought on coinbase or binance through blockchain analysis, two separate monero coins transacted from darknet or binance appear exactly the same and can't be distinguished. this is the reason financial regulators can trace bitcoin transactions but not xmr payments.\n\n\#how does monero (xmr) work?\n\nmonero is able to maintain privacy and anonymity through these two important processes: stealth addresses and ring signature\n\nstealth addresses allow the sender to create a public address on behalf of the recipient for every single transaction. so every transaction is able to create its own public address to maintain privacy and anonymity. every monero user can generate a private view key and a private spend key. the private view key allows the user to see transactions within their account but is unable to transact with it. while the private spend key allows them to authorize payments and transactions\n\nring signatures is a concept from cryptography which means that the signature can be signed by any member of a specific group of people who possess private keys. every time someone makes a xmr transaction, the monero wallet forms a ring from other users' keys it pulls from the blockchain. it makes it impossible for people observing which and whose keys were being used to sign. furthermore, in january 2017, monero introduced ringct which hides the value of transactions.\n\n\#what makes monero (xmr) unique?\n\nmonero has anonymous developers and open-source code. it may sound similar to bitcoin but there are major differences, most notably by the way updates and forks are handled. monero is software is programmed to update every six months autonomously unlike bitcoin which is somewhat reluctant when it comes to forks or updates.\n\nfor monero users, the value of monero comes from its privacy and anonymity. it liberates monero users to transact whenever and for whatever reason they want without being able to be observed by anyone. in addition to that, a lot of its investors believe that demand for privacy will increase over time and drive up the price of the xmr itself.\n\n\#what is the supply of monero (xmr)?\n\nmonero (xmr) currently has a circulating supply of 18,004,702 xmr. it will reach a total supply of 18.4 million xmr by may 2022. there is no max supply in the monero blockchain and it will continue to produce 0.6 xmr per block infinitely to incentivize the miners.\n\n\#conclusion\n\nwhile bitcoin will always pioneers the crypto industry as being the first digital currency ever created. monero differentiates itself from other cryptos by being the most private and achieved financial anonymity. although there are a few other privacy coins available on the market, monero is able to differentiate itself by features such as stealth addresses and ring signatures, plus the asic resistance, and able to become the biggest privacy coin by market cap.\n\nthe monero (xmr) success is also driven by the fact that the community itself is driven more by ideals of complete anonymity should be a fundamental right rather than pursue of profits.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nhelpful links\n\n[",Neutral sentiment,775

"a newbie navigating wallets, exchanges, and conversions: a series of unfortunate events i made a series of uninformed decisions that i thought i someone should know about. i'm mostly posting this as a warning to other newbies, but maybe someone could teach me something.\n\ninspired by the sudden explosion in investing early this year, i began my journey into buying crypto. i was smart enough to avoid using robinhood, but otherwise i was just bright eyed and bushy tailed entering a world i didn't know very well. i started with a few small purchases on coinbase. i bought some small amounts of btc, some eth, and some xlm based on very light research. i even bought like 5 xtz at some point after being impressed by their mission.\n\nat some point it seemed like the general consensus was to put those in a wallet to keep them safe. ""not your keys, not your coins,"" right? **this might have been my first mistake.** i used the coinbase wallet and quickly learned about the fees for transferring. my $100 eth turned in $70 just that quickly. and if i want to put it back on the exchange? i'd be lucky to end up with $50 in eth.\n\ntransferring xlm was much less expensive. after learning about the cheaper fees on coinbase pro, i decided i would pull the xlm out of my wallet and put it on coinbase pro to play around with. **this was my second mistake.** to transfer xlm, you need to include a memo. forgetting the memo, my xlm completed the transfer, but it sure as hell wasn't on my coinbase pro account. after contacting coinbase pro, they quickly told me to transfer an exact amount of xlm from the wallet back to the coinbase pro exchange in order to confirm my transaction and get my original xlm back. i bought a little bit more xlm, attempted the transfer with that exact amount (and a memo this time) only to have this xlm disappear as well. it has been almost a month, and coinbase support still has not responded to my repeated inquiries.\n\nfeeling both stupid and cheated, i decided to go elsewhere for crypto. i made my way over to kraken and deposited my small amount of xtz. after the filecoin double deposit debacle, i thought i'd take a chance converting my xtz to siacoin. i'm happy with that decision, but kraken is not as user friendly as coinbase. **this was my third mistake.** i didn't research kraken as well, and it appears i cannot link it directly to my bank account. neither coinbase nor binance.us support sia, so the only way i can think to get it out is convert it (fees), transfer it (fees), then sell it (fees). i'm not even sure if i have enough to even cover that amount.\n\nnow i technically own a diverse portfolio, but the amounts are so small i can't really do anything with it. i have an amount of eth that i can't realistically move from one wallet, some xlm that disappeared into nothingness, some sia that might as well be imaginary, and hell, i even purchased a small amount of bnb on binance. it might all total an amount that would cover a month of rent, but at this point it is so spread out that i can't realistically recover that much from it.\n\ni'm not too upset, and this has all been a learning experience, but i hope others can learn from my mistakes. if you're planning to buy a good amount and hold long term, just stuff it in a wallet and forget it. and if you want to trade it back and forth and sell it quickly, and exchange is great. but please, just don't do what i did and put small amounts of different coins on different exchanges and in different wallets. and for the love of god, do a little research first.",Neutral sentiment,822

They are nice for giving people small bitcoin gifts, but also for long-term storage if properly used. What you want to do is generate and print them offline. You can save the linked page https://www.bitaddress.org/ for example and run that offline. If you are really paranoid, you can put it on read-only media and access that from a different computer. For really long term storage, use archival-grade paper.\n\nAnother approach to take is using a separate computer for storing your money that is offline 99+% of the time. You could set one up easily by buying an old laptop, reformatting it, installing Linux and a Bitcoin client. Generate an address on that machine and send money to it from your main wallet. Depending on how paranoid you are you can connect that computer to the Internet afterwards to synchronize data with the Bitcoin Network and then turn it off and put it away somewhere safe until itï¿½s needed.""",Question,628

"safely buying and holding alt coins hello all,\n\ni have a coinbase account but there are coins on there i would like to purchase for a long term hold (like vra) but they are not supported on coinbase although i can see the price. \n\ni have searched and know that i would have to set up an account on another exchange and send my etherum from coinbase, then swap it for my desired coin on the exchange. i saw a guide for this referencing bybit from last year but i googled them and saw they were hacked last month i saw so i don't know what is safe and how to do this smartly. does anyone had advice on what to do or maybe where to learn legit info? i would want to be able to have the opportunity to get as many different coins and not have accounts and x number of different exchanges. \n\ni know a cold wallet can be used but i don't know if these coins are able to get on there, if there is danger of them not working if i try to reupload, it is just very overwhelming and i don't want to make some dumb mistake and lose my money or even worse, find out i did something wrong 10 years later and i can't get to the coins to cash them in.\n\ni'm sure i'm not the first person to ask this, thank you all for any advice. i believe crypto is just getting started and want to be ready for the next pop.",Question,306

"i admit it, i'm addicted to crypto. it all started in february when elon musk tweeted about doge. i was originally on the gme hype train but i guess i hopped off at crypto station because after i started to learn about crypto and this subreddit, i quickly sold all my stocks and transferred that money into crypto.\n\nwhat started out as throwing a few bucks into funny sounding shit coins quickly snowballed into something much more. since february, i have put in close to over 150 hours of research/watching youtubers shill shitcoins. while i am not a pro in the crypto space i've gained enough knowledge to help my friends get started. after reading a few post about people losing friendships due to crypto, i only showed them how to sign up for exchanges (coinbase/gemini) and what hardware wallets are. i figured these are the basis to start building a crypto foundation off of and i really don't want to lose any of my friends, considering i only have three.\n\non average i spend approximately 2 hours on coin market cap every week starting at graphs pretending i know what i'm looking at. i even have a third monitor for the soul purpose of having coin market cap open 24/7. i'm sure there is a few other people out there who have a similar experience. but now my entire world revolves around crypto and i don't really know what to think of it yet. am i an idiot for investing a lot of time and money on ""internet coins"". or am i smart as i'm trying have that ""ahead of the herd mentality"". \n\ni like to end this post with a general question: what brought you into the crypto space. and what is keeping you from leaving?
