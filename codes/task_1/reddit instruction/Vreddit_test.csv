"tips for new or existing crypto investors happy new years everyone! here are some resolutions and things to remember when going into 2022. \n\n1) always invest in the king and queen. bitcoin and ethereum are the most solid projects in crypto are will anchor your portfolio. \n2) diversify but not too much. do not put all your eggs in one basket but dont over spread. too hard to manage and keep up to date with everything. \n3) if it sounds too good to be true, it more than likely is. yes you can make good profits from crypto but the odds of becoming a millionaire overnight is not realistic at all for 99% of crypto users. \n4) remember to take profits (dca out). yes i know we all love to hodl and i'm saying you shouldn't, i am saying make sure and capitalize on the stretches of gains. take some out and stake with stable coins. when a dip happens, sell stable coins and then buy. \n5) careful with the memecoins. have some fun in life and gamble a little but remember, it is very much a gamble. \n6) dyor. make sure and do your own research people and do not blindly follow people. most people around here, myself included, have little to no idea what is actually going to happen. \n7) remember that time in market is better than timing the market. as mentioned before, becoming a millionaire doesn't happen overnight. \n8) only invest what you can afford to lose! investments are never a sure thing. be prepared to lose it all. if you can live with that, then you are in a comfortable place. \n9) set a goal and be happy when you reach it. dont be greedy here people. if you goal is to pay for college, get that down payment for a house (or buy a house), get a new car if you need it, then buy means do it! don't be too greedy here people. \n10) take care of yourself. there is life outside staring at a screen all day long! make sure and remember to life your life!",Miscellaneous,444
did i make a newbie mistake? i entered the crypto space in q2 this year and got fascinated of what could be possible in the upcoming years with all this new technology. but i also experienced the may crash. i got really nervous to hold it but iâ€™m glad i did. after the new surge of rising prices i thought i should take some profits. so i did my own research like this sub is always telling you and i loaded my bags with algo and avax. i accumulated avax at like $15 and staked it. afterwards i saw the rise till 80 bucks but couldnâ€™t take the profits due to stake locking. it made me nervous so i after the lockout period i moved my avax to an exchange with sell order at $75 for a good 5x. but yeah now i see i could have a 10x within 3 weeks and iâ€™m asking myself if it was dumb to sell everything instead of maybe just half of the whole stack. is it common to only sell max 50% of your coins or what is a proper trading strategy? \n\nthanks in advance,Negative,233

You are free to transfer your coins without any limitations (we can?t suspend withdrawals during a crash even if we want to XD)\n\nMagic?s delegated key management system uses AWS KMS to store your keys in Hardware Security Modules (HSMs), which work similar to hardware wallets like Ledger, Trezor etc. All encryption and decryption operations happen inside the HSMs themselves, so an attacker can?t just leak your encrypted keys to the world and hope to brute force it. \n\nYou can read Magic?s whitepaper here: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/3flqaszoigwis5b/Magic%20Whitepaper.pdf?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3flqaszoigwis5b/Magic%20Whitepaper.pdf?dl=0)\n\n**Buy using INR**\n\nFor Indian users, we have partnered with OnMeta for fiat on-ramps. It is well integrated within our platform so the user experience is much better and your don?t have to deal with any p2p scams.\n\nIf you are outside India you can use Transak for fiat conversion. It is also integrated within our platform. \n\n**Fees:**\n\nWe don?t charge any trading fee. Though you will have to pay the polygon network (gas) fee, which currently is hovering around Rs.1- 2 per trade. However, 1inch will charge a trade fee based on the DEXes it uses for your trade (the rates are lower or similar to most centralized exchanges depending on the pair)\n\n**Transfer**\n\nThere won?t be any limitation in transferring coins to or from our platform. Since we are only a platform, we don?t facilitate fiat withdrawals. Onmeta is working on this, so hopefully it will be available soon. Other manual options like using Incento or Cryptorefills to withdraw are given in our app. \n\n**What?s Next**\n\n1. We will be adding more chains to expand our coin offerings\n2. We will be adding more yield bearing products\n3. Curated data and research to help you make informed investment decisions (DYOR made easier)\n4. Releasing the iOS version soon.

"Politician Malaysia wants to help youth by legalizing cryptocurrency Which country will follow El Salvador in making bitcoin a legal tender? There are rumors of Honduras, but Malaysia is emerging as a willing country to legalize cryptocurrency.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Consider making crypto a legal tender**\n\nDatuk Zahidi Zainul Abidin, Malaysia is Deputy Minister in the Ministry of Communications and Multimedia, [told parliament](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2022/03/21/comms-ministry-proposes-adopting-cryptocurrency-as-legal-tender) Monday that the country should consider adopting cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin as legal tender.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Youth love NFT**\n\nThe reason? The deputy minister is looking to the future and the youth. By making cryptocurrency a legal tender, he wants to support the young generation. Young Malaysians are active users of crypto and according to Abidin, they are also very active on exchanges for non-fungible tokens (NFT).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*""We hope the government will allow and legalize this so we can increase the acceptance of cryptocurrencies by young people.""*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Future of finance**\n\nFor a politician, this is incredibly progressive. Just go figure, when have you heard a politician so concrete with solutions to help the youth. Zahidi said his Ministry of Communications and Multimedia will explore ways to increase youth involvement in digital currency, as this is the future of finance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Central bank determines**\n\nHe acknowledged that his ministry can only express the desire, but that the keys are in the hands of the central bank and the financial watchdog.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*""All these fall under the jurisdiction of Bank Negara Malaysia and the Securities Commission,""* he said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis statement did not come out of the blue. Yesterday, Zahidi said this in the Dewan Rakyat in response to a supplementary question from Syed Ibrahim Syed Noh (other politician) about the government is position on trading on NFT platforms. Indeed, trading is becoming increasingly popular, especially among the younger generation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Investigation into CBDC.**\n\nThis is the first time that cryptocurrency has come out as legal tender in Malaysia. It was previously announced, however, that Malaysia joined a central bank digital currency study (CBDC) with the Bank for International Settlements, Singapore, Australia and South Africa. The aim is to test real life cross-border CBDC transactions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Permission for share tokens**\n\nThere is more news from Malaysia. Fusang Corp. a Malaysia-based digital stock exchange, [has announced](https://www.fusang.co/news/fusang-announces-first-digital-security-ipo-public-listing-for-a-defi-platform) that it has obtained regulatory approval for an initial public offering (IPO) of its share tokens. This is somewhat similar to BNB on the Binance exchange, but with regulatory approval.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Genuine share certificates**\n\nThe tokens represent Fusang is shares in digital form, and are registered on a blockchain (from Ethereum) rather than a traditional share register. They will be listed on Fusang is own Exchange within a few weeks, Fusang CEO Henry Chong told me. While other companies have issued security tokens in the past, Fusang is will be the world is first IPO of fully regulated share tokens, according to Chong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*""This is not a token assigned somewhere to an offline paper share,""* Chong said. *""This is not a derivative or anything like that. These tokens are really the share certificates and we sincerely believe that this is the future of the security token market.""*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Emergence of security tokens**\n\nThis has been the promise of security tokens for years: that shares of companies are converted into tokens with legal and notarial approval.

chronos defi? so im pretty heavy and bullish on cro i have a smaller bag of unstaked cro sitting around. im interested in staking it. im in the us so less options than others from my understanding. \n\ni know the chronos network is brand new. i understand there is lots of unknowns and risk and volatility. \n\nfor fun i did a tiny amount of cro staked in crofarm \n\ni put a small amount in vvs this morning.\n\nanyone using these? any ideas? i get it could be a rug pull but crypto.com defi wallet allows for vvs staking so i would be shocked if it was super shady. \n\nlet me know your thoughts.,Question,153

"how we get rewarded to hodl i live in austria and we pay ~50% taxes on speculation, which cryptocurrencys fall under(like gambling) but.... and that is the big but. we pay zero % taxes for any position held longer than one calender year, making hodling the most lucrative form of crypto investment. even if you were a top day trader, you'd still have to produce 50% more profit by the end of the year to make more cash than hodling. \n\ni think our neighbor germany has something similar in place.\n\n\ni'm sure many other countries benefit the people who hodl more than daytraders and crypto gamblers. i'd say it is worth finding out what kind of benefits you get from which form of trading when it comes to taxes, before starting to invest. \n\nthis is not financial advise, due to the fact that i'm a moron and the last person you should listen to when it comes to money... just saying, there might be something similar where you're located.",Neutral sentiment,218

"what to expect in the near future. *original post for bscgemsinsider on telegram*\nimportant read\nyesterdays dip was a cause of market manipulation. many whales were holding btc leverage trades at a liquidation price of $38k because that seemed like a strong support level. other whales and large traders caught wind of this and took the opportunity to pull out and dump btc below $38k which caused billions of dollars to be liquidated, dropping the price further. the best thing to do in this scenario is understand that the crypto fundamentals have not changed and there is no reason to sell during the dip. that being said, we are on an uptrend once again but theres a good chance this could be a fake out and we could have another dip before we go parabolic. the best thing to do in this scenario is to find a support level of the cryptos you are holding and set a stoploss just below that. if it hits the stoploss, simply wait until the dip bottoms out then buy back in again for a discount. we are not in a bear market. there is still plenty of growth left in the long run. good luck everyone",Positive,238

"my mum owns crypto after hearing me talk about it all year i got into the game this time last year and just have not shut up about it in this time. i never pressured anyone to buy because i strongly believe money and family dont mix but when my younger brother showed interest, i brought and am holding 0.001 btc for him, not a lot but a start. hes said he doesnt want to touch it till hes 18 at least, awesome, anyway thats a story on my profile i've already told, moving on...\n\ntoday my mums friend told her that she (the friend) had been encouraged to by dogecoin by her son. i immediately died inside. my mum was adament she'd wanted in because of the gains and the fact i'd made 1200% on doge (sold) which she knew. i spent the day running errands with her, talking to her about the musk hype, the inflation, general crypto cycles and crashes. i explained the dangers of buying the hype and effectively said crypto is a lottery ticket, when you buy it you have to see the money as spent with no reward, and to expect no reward.\n\nafter going through all this she still wanted in on crypto but had gone off the idea of doge (thank god). i helped set up a wallet and exchange, explained the intricacies then gifted her 0.002 btc to lower her buy in average and mitigate risk. \n\nas far as i'm concerned, i dont want to be pushy about crypto but if theres the willingness to learn then i'm willing to gift. i hope this is what sounds like a non annoying way to enable adoption.\n\ni've read two posts about gifting coins and tbh, i agree its nice to gift coins. but these times i've gifted coins (to brother and mum), they only received the coins verbally. my mum only received hers because she created her own wallet which showed me this wouldn't contribute to lost coins. my brother asked me to hold on to his for him which is fine. the point being, gifting things is great but shoving coins onto people who don't have a clue wont always lead to adoption but more likely lead to lost coins. gift responsibly.",Negative,464

"buying crypto has got to be made easier if we ever want this to be mainstream. allow me to tell you a story. over the past few days, i've been hearing a lot about nano. i've done some research and decided that i want to buy some to see where it goes. if it does well enough, i might even start using it to process payments for my business.\n\nhow do you buy nano? i ask myself. like most beginners in crypto, i only use a couple tools- a wallet, coinbase, and binance. nano isn't even available on coinbase, so that is out of the question. how bout binance? it is there, but i can't log into my account- i get 403 errors. odd, but okay.\n\nhow else could i buy it? i do a google search and check nano is own website. wirex? can't, i'm american. coingate? american. moonpay? american. simplex? american. swapzone? i think that would work, but i would need to already have crypto, pay a fee to deposit it, then pay another fee to exchange it, then pay a third fee to put it in my wallet. kraken? maybe kraken. i uploaded my documents and am now waiting for permission to buy tether, which i can exchange for nano.\n\nevery step along the way i've had to create an account, verify my email, upload id paperwork (!!), and then be denied. it has taken about two hours, i've exposed myself to a huge amount of id theft, and i am feeling very frustrated. **there is no way people will use crypto as a currency if it remains this difficult to acquire.** we have got to make this easier and more transparent.",Question,368

"i tried to teach my kids a lesson in crypto and failed sorry if this isn't allowed, but a true story that has created a dilemma for me follows.\n\nso my kids are under 10, but they like to learn about everything, especially if their dad is doing it so a few days ago i decided to teach them what i know about crypto (so not much). this is with the thought that in the bear run i will be buying them all Â£100 of crypto each that they're not allowed until they're 18. i will be giving them a list of coins they are allowed and then they look into them and choose and whatever it is when they're 18 they'll receive in full. \n\nall sounded like a good idea until we were going through why i was giving them a list of coins and started showing them shit coins and how you can call a coin anything and the name of it doesn't mean anything, so don't judge on that. that made us come across poocoin. i wasn't aware of this coin or it is utilities on the bsc so to prove a point i went blind in with Â£5 to show them how quickly it gets to Â£0. \n\nimagine my horror as the further i have been personally dipping into bsc (i've been obsessed), that i was using poo coin website a lot. imagine my shock walking up this morning and the Â£5 is now Â£40. this is not a shill for poocoin. i still don't know it is tokenomics or why it is actually needed as a coin alongside it is charts, i don't even know how many coins there are or its market cap. \n\ni spoke to my wife this morning and we've agreed that we hope it will sharply decline before my kids ask to see where it has got to, while i'm secretly wishing i'd put my whole portfolio into the joke, because 8x is 8x. it is looking like it might dip though now so i may be saved.\n\ni know this sounds like a hidden shill and ridiculous, but seriously, think how i feel. on one hand is a nice little profit, on the other hand i've taught my kids the worst lesson.\n\ntldr: tried to teach my kids about shit coins by buying a literal poocoin which has since performed better than my whole portfolio since.",Neutral sentiment,497

"Is transferring trx to FTX exchange from CoinDCX and then converting to USD to purchase crypto illegal?**Premise**\n\nGiven the volatile situation with a lot of exchanges halting withdrawals of cryptos, especially in India, in order to safeguard my investments, I wanted to devise an approach to offload my crypto to a cold wallet. I do intend to hold long-term and am not interested in trading.\n\n**Approach**\n\nSo I figured the best thing to do was as follows\n\n1. Open an account with Binance or FTX\n2. Since CoinDCX doesn't allow direct withdrawal of cryptos except for BTC and TRX, sell my positions (which are at a severe loss) for INR on CoinDCX and purchase an equivalent amount of TRX on CoinDCX eg. Sell XRP for INR, and buy TRX with the INR amount.\n3. Transfer the TRX from CoinDCX to Binance/FTX\n4. Convert the TRX to USD on Binance/FTX\n5. Purchase the same value of the sold asset using USD (either through spot or a DCA over a period of time for the relevant USD value)\n6. Once I have purchased the crypto, directly move the crypto to my cold wallet\n\n**Question**\n\nI am keeping a track of each sale and purchase and it's INR value so I can keep aside the 1% TDS to then pay at the end of the year. I also do understand that when I do finally sell, I will need to pay 30% tax on any profit I make on the sale. \n\nHowever, I wanted to understand if the approach I am taking is fine or is it problematic from a legal/tax perspective\n\nI know this is a new situation we have in India so I genuinely appreciate the advice\n\nThanks in Advance",Question,397
