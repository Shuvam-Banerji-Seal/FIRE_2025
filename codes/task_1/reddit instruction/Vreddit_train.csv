It?s a peer-to-peer system that enables anyone to send and receive payments anywhere. Instead of being physical money carried around and exchanged in the real world, cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries to an online database describing specific transactions. The transactions are recorded in a public ledger when you transfer cryptocurrency funds. Cryptocurrency is stored in digital wallets.\n\nCryptocurrency received its name because it uses encryption to verify transactions. This means advanced coding is involved in storing and transmitting cryptocurrency data between wallets and public ledgers. The aim of encryption is to provide security and safety.\n\nThe first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, founded in 2009,d is the best known today.

"decentralized v/s centralized gambling **what is decentralized gambling and how does it differ from centralized one?**\n\nonline gambling has been a massive industry in many countries around the world for the past decade, especially considering that various large companies have played their part in this expansion. recently, however, a new form of online betting has begun to emerge alongside the ever-increasing relevance of cryptocurrency: decentralized gambling.\n\nat its core, decentralized gambling is about reducing the custodial element of online gambing, with shorter waiting times for processes such as registration, deposit and withdrawal of funds, as well as giving the player more control over their own funds when gambling. this makes decentralized gabling more appetible to many users who are passionate about gambling. that being said there are also a few downsides to it. letâ€™s start by addressing in full what decentralized gambling actually means.\n\n**how does decentralized gambling work?**\n\ndecentralized gambling is essentially a method of gambling that provides a mechanism for players to attach their cryptocurrency wallets to the operator website, therefore giving them full control over their funds at all times. these wallets are linked to blockchain technology which is the key to offering the decentralized gambling industry with security, privacy and cost-effectiveness. this is in part due to the fact that the blockchain database creates a decentralized digital and chronological record of all transactions that take place. this serves both casino operators and players well because it increases confidence in transactions that do not need to be analyzed by a third party in order to ensure fairness.\n\n**the main differences between decentralized and centralized gambling**\n\nas stated above, the main difference is that rather than being stored on a centralized server, decentralized gambling applications are stored on a cryptoâ€™s blockchain. but what does that mean for the actual lived experience of the player? first of all, they are not dependent on gambling operators for processes and formalities such as deposits and receiving their winnings, like they would be in a normal online casino. \n\nwith crypto gambling, there is no central authority, meaning that players have full liberty on their transactions (deposits, withdrawals and fund distributions) which are, again, recorded, transparent and open to all. players therefore do not face delays in receiving their winnings, which in decentralized gambling are released immediately by smart contracts.\n\nanother key difference is anonymity. in centralized online casinos, players must open accounts by inserting personal details like name, address, as well as usually having to provide photo id and a copy of credit cards. such compliances are unnecessary in decentralized gambling as players gamble through their unique wallet address and only have to provide a name and email address.\n\n**the link between blockchain and security**\n\nas previously implied, an elevated degree of security is one of the main attractions that decentralized gambling can offer. this is primarily due to the fact that this form of betting depends on cryptocurrency transactions. the lack of a centralized authority or third-party verification enables players to have full liberty over their transactions and ensures that there are almost no chances of fraud occurring. \n\nthis happens because all movements, including withdrawals, deposits and other fund distributions, are recorded on an instrument called the distributed ledger technology (dlt) of the blockchain, and are furthermore processed by smart contracts that can be accessed and surveyed by anyone at any time, giving the process the utmost level of transparency.\n\n[",Neutral sentiment,694

"extremely unpopular opinion: there will likely always be a centralized crypto/blockchains/projects in the top 10. despite all the hate given to centralized crypto/blockchains/projects, a cryptocurrency is essentially also an investment instrument, so for the purpose of diversification, investors would like to own cryptocurrencies that have some differing characteristics. \n\ne.g if an investor only chooses to hold the ""store of value coins"" i.e digital gold/silver there is no real benefit to owning both bitcoin and litecoin, might as well just choose the more popular one which is bitcoin. on the other hand, ethereum offers something different which is defi, while doge offers ... err.. something different by being a joke/meme coin i suppose. then you have bnb which offers cedefi, xrp which is trying to be some sort of remittance/payments system for banks, usdt which is a stablecoin that has high usage and liquidity. \n\nplease note that i am looking at this from an investor perspective, i get that bnb doesn't offer cedefi it is actually bsc and other technical stuff. for most non tech savvy investors bnb = bsc = cedefi = binance and eth = ethereum = defi (i know i know, eth = the fuel used to power the network bla bla and ethereum refers to the network but who cares??). \n\nanyway the point is i don't know what will be in the top 10 in the future or but my opinion is that there will be some well diversified cryptos in there, and there will likely be some centralized options as well.",Neutral sentiment,332

"breaking the negative feedback loop hi everyone. i'm fairly new to buying crypto, but nonetheless it seems like i have been picking up on some patterns at least already.\n\none of those things i'm noticing now, is that when the prices dip like they do now, there is a lot of fud, often caused by the people buying crypto themselves. which creates this negative feedback loop and prices go down even more. for example, people love bringing up the previous crash of prices, while in reality it seems like a whole different situation to me this time around.\n\nso my point of this post, is to propose that we try and break this negative feedback loop and focus on the positive things, such that we can really see this price dip as nothing more than a dip. we should spread the news about how we shattered new records in this last period and i propose to really focus on the main ideas behind these decentralized currencies (or even decentralized computing platforms).\n\nwe should spread the news about why they matter and what good they can bring to the world. i for example really believe in this technology, mostly because of the potential of having decentralized applications in a way we have not seen before. this is also why i strongly believe that crypto is will bounce back up, i don't know when, but i think it will happen. \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nanyway, let is spread some positivity, no just around here, but anywhere we can. in general the sentiment around crypto has only improved, let is keep improving it.",Positive,318

In 2018 they told you straight to your face; ï¿½We will tame Bitcoin.ï¿½ And they did. The bear market started that same week. \n\nIn 2021 They got you buying BTC at $50k and $60k directly from them after they had bought for $4k - $10k. \n\nThey led you to believe that institutions would experience FOMO at those levels and abandon their fiduciary duty to their clients to pile into BTC. \n\nThey know you wouldnï¿½t stop to think how ridiculous that sounds because youï¿½re trading on hope, and theyï¿½re trading on math, manipulations, connections, and a keen understanding of human emotion. \n\nThey know that many people will capitulate - buy high, sell low.

"Crypto Market Update (week 37) C**rypto and equities markets finished the last week with losses, preparing for this week?s FED announcements.** Crypto markets dropped heavily with Bitcoin down by over 10% compared to the previous week, closing at 19.419 on Sunday. ETH experienced the biggest slump by almost 25%.\n\nThe Merge had successfully taken place on September 15th, 2022, at 08:42:42 GMT+2 at a Block #15.537.393, marking the full transition of the network from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), which will cut energy consumption by about 99.95% compared to the PoW consensus mechanism. However, the successful upgrade had not fuelled the Ether?s price further up. Instead, the price remained flat at the Merge event and finished the week down at 1.335. Equities, on the other hand, dropped by around 5% with NASDAQ closing at 11.448 and S&amp;P closing at 3.873 last Friday.\n\n**The FED is expected to raise interest rates by another 0.75% this week.** The consumer price index, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on last Tuesday, increased by 0.1% in August, ending at 8.3%, down from 8.5% in July 2022, but still at four-decade highs. Headline inflation rose 0.1% month over month, even with falling petrol prices.\n\nCore inflation rose 0.6% month over month, translating to an annual increase of 6.3%, up from 5.9% recorded during the previous period. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been expecting a decline of 0.1% for overall inflation, with a rise of 0.3% for core inflation. Moreover, Economists polled by Reuters forecast the CPI fell by 0.1% month-on-month in August, resulting in 8.1% for August 2022, down from 8.5% a month earlier.\n\nDespite the drop in gasoline prices, the rise in core inflation fuelled speculation that the FED will have to step up with further rate increases on its next meetings. According to Refinitiv, **the new expectations point the federal funds rate to a new target range of 3.80% to 4.20% by end of 2022, with a peak of 3.94% ? 4.45% around March 2023.**\n\nOverall, the crypto market sentiment (measured by Crypto Fear &amp; Greed Index) continues to stand at **21/100, indicating Extreme Fear**, compared to a month ago when the Index stood at 29/100. The total crypto market cap had dropped by almost 10%, crossing below the $1 trillion mark. ETH dominance slightly dropped to 18% (from 20.5%) and Bitcoin went slightly up to 39.4%. As we had pointed out in our previous week?s macro analysis, the ETH Merge was a typical buy-the-rumour-sell-the-news event. The Protocol?s technical upgrade had already been priced in.\n\n**WATCH OUT FOR:** The next monetary policy meetings are scheduled for September 20-21st, 2022 for the FED and October 27th, 2022, for the ECB. The next US CPI release for September 2022 is scheduled for October 13th, 2022. The next US GDP update will be released on September 29th, 2022, followed by October 27th. 2022.",Objective,770

"Update on the market after the Luna CrashHey Guys! I want to update with you on my thoughts on the Crypto market and the recent crashes and also to warn you of few potential dangers. I wanted to post this a couple of days back, but since I was packed up and had limited knowledge on the situation, I waited till I did proper research on this. \n\n**Why did Terra-Money Crash?**\n\nTerra-Money is a stable coin project launched by Do Kwon, it's main objective was to make a truly decentralized Stablecoin (UST) which is not backed by fiat or any other centralised asset, So the LUNA token was born to peg the UST to make sure the UST is stable. Needless to say, even a child can see how weak and volatile that is going to be. It was never really a strong project to begin with regardless of the attacks. \n\n**Will Terra-Money Recover?**\n\nI know its been tough, to hold through this and bleed your money. The network has been halted, Do kwon accepted a community idea of recovering the stable coin which Do Kwon accepted but its highly unlikely that UST will be stable any time soon. the future of LUNA is even dimmer, With the most optimistic thought, I'd say both might survive, But UST won't be a stablecoin and LUNA won't recover for at least a couple of years. \n\n**What does it mean for the rest of the Stablecoins?**\n\nThis just shows, how fragile the market is and to what extent whales can manipulate the price, this was probably the biggest blow, in the history of Investment. However, this is a clear indication of War against Centralised and Decentralised Crypto. Central Banks, Investment firms will short and remove it  from existence if it directly threats them. If you are holding any other Decentralised Stable Coin or a coin which is backing the stablecoin. Watch out!\n\nsome examples are USDD and TRON Coin, DAI and MakerDao, USDN and Waves, and a bunch of other Stable coin which are backed by crypto are all at risk\n\nI am personally not worried for USDC or USDT crashing cause if they do its the end of all economy and Crypto as we know it. \n\n**What does it mean for the rest of the Crypto-Currencies?**\n\nA lot of people are asking/saying things like, this is the end of Crypto Currency, Prices will never recover, etc. These statements has no logic or reason behind them other than pure emotion. \n\nCrypto market will be up again, with or without LUNA. The Economy is at a Crisis, every currency (fiat and crypto) are falling so its natural for other cryptos to be down. Also this Luna crash might have added salt to injury. But there's no point is staying away from them, when they are backed by Literal Countries and a lot of Whales. \n\nBe careful, even though the market will recover, some of the coins will weak fundamentals might never recover. so please focus on the fundamentals and the people behind the project before investing.",Question,666

"How I Turned a 495 Matic($325) Investment into 2873 Matic($2500) in a just 25 Days.\n\nIn my companion circle, we examine a few distinct undertakings and thoughts for procuring automated revenue. An end that we as a whole came to settle on was that it is generally critical to know when a task is sending off and get in right on time. At times, a venture can be at 0.0004 per token or even less.\n\nThe task talked about in this article. This isn?t focused on crypto novices, this is for people currently acquainted with involving wallets in DeFi, best wellbeing rehearses, gas charges, and crossing over of tokens.\n\nSo here is how I turned a 495 Matic ($325)investment on VaporNodes into 2873($2500) in 30 Days.\n\nI Monitored Social Media\n\nThe only way to find out about new and upcoming projects is to keep up to date through Twitter, Medium, Telegram, and Discord. Watch for new projects and investigate them.\n\nI Observed The Network\n\nIt?s basic to be familiar with the association the endeavor runs of by virtue of gas costs to ensure rewards. By virtue of VaporNodes it runs on Avalanche Network. Expecting that a comparable errand were on the Ethereum association, *Polygon Network* I could never have potentially contributed because of the gas charges.\n\nI Bought the Project Token in Earlier phase into Launch\n\nOnce I assessed the risk of the project, I invested in the token and hold as much to get good results. One more important thing is I always took Principle (Investment) on the pump and get my investment Principle. This all happened in the span of a few weeks. I wanted my initial investment back. I only kept *495 Matic* worth of *PNT Token* at that time and put that into a Trust wallet Dapp.\n\nThe price of PNT has moved up to 0.002240 matic. It's still early until it reaches 1 PNT = 1 Matic\n\nIntroduction Of PNT Token\n\nThe Polyatomic Network is a decentralized application based on the Polygon blockchain that has been capturing value by offering the most attractive spreads, an auto-adjusting spec and consumption component, and frictionless, separate compensation for a long time in the MATIC coin.\n\nThis is probably the best work on Polygon Blockchain that can generate unregulated revenue through the fantastic protocol in dApps.\n\nTheir local area strengths coupled with fun opportunities, and a ton of imaginative changes to the digital currency universe will cause it to grow into an enterprise worth watching.\n\nThe PNT TOKEN:\n\nPNT (Polytomic Network Token) is the power and close by token for Polytomic Network. The PNT savvy understanding is a self-making pay framework for holders.\n\nIt is a neighborhood project that spreads and remunerates MATIC between neighborhoods subject to clear conditions.\n\nIt was built on the Polygon blockchain, and PNT tokens can be purchased with MATIC in the Polyatomic dApp on TrustWallet/Metamask.\n\nThe installment to buy PNT is in MATIC and not in dollars, so eventually you will have the opportunity to profit from any cost increase. Holders can sell their PNT at the point when they need it which makes it perfectly suited for them.\n\nNothing is found on record so holders get two benefits in MATIC coin as well as price energy for PNT which becomes more MATIC.\n\nRewards\n\nThe MATIC reflection token has shown the ultimate fate of biological systems. HODLers of PNT will receive secret rewards by basically holding the tokens in their wallets, as each exchange such as purchases, sales and profit withdrawals individually has spending fees of 10%, 10% and 10% which are all existing symbolically. is expressed equally. In the wallet of the holders is indicated by their PNT volume.\n\nFor each exchange, a piece is saved to boost the liquidity pool and prize pool for all holders. Thereafter, PNT intends to pursue a 'Hold and Procure' culture, thereby reducing the selling pressure.\n\nThis is accomplished through smart contract capacities, which mechanize the symbolic rearrangement, and those holders should simply deal with the wallet in which their tokens are put away.\n\nRewards are naturally accessible to circulate once every new client purchases the PNT in their dApp. Probably the best element is that you have control of your own prizes payouts by pulling out at whatever point you need in the Polytomic dApp.\n\nBenefits Of Income\n\nThe benefits of income are very important here. The Polyatomic Network (PNT) is the first to provide huge income from its system whenever someone buys a PNT token. 65% goes to the PNT community and 35% is distributed to all PNT holders according to their PNT holdings. So here you have maximum PNT and you will get big profit.\n\n\nThe second biggest benefit is passive income. Here one can make $1,000,000 matic or more by passive or by recommending other people. The above passive is described as your direct reference (1st level) you get 10%, 2nd level 4%, 3rd level 2%, 4th level 1%, 5th to 10th level 0.5%, 11th to 14th level 0.25% And get 15th level. The level is 1%. One can make huge profits by recommending through this robust system.\n\n\n Step by Step Instructions to Start\n\n1. Download Trustwallet or MetaMask and send all MATIC into it through your trade by means of the Polygon organization.\n\n2. Go to dApps section in trustwallet and paste this link?[Polytomic ](https://polytomic.network/registration/?referral=0xd4320bE6BFC32dDF53480140a12ceEC4C20B1549)\n\n3. Ensure that you are associated with the polygon Network which you can see on the upper right of the picture.\n\n4. Subsequent to associating with the wallet, store all the MATIC that you have and enlist it.\n\n5. There you go, now you?re a holder of Polytomic Network Token. Get ready to receive a daily dividend!\n\nThis is another undertaking with many things on the way. This is a great opportunity to buy a ton of MATICs and for those who have opened doors like this before. Assuming you have any inquiries and guides, then go ahead and message me on Telegram and WhatsApp.\n\nPNT is the project that successfully gave away thousands of metrics while holding the PNT token. As the price of PNT's Matic and Community increases, the PNT's price also increases, resulting in more Polygon (Matic) earnings.\n\nIf you found this article helpful, follow, clap and share with your friends!\n\nI would also be grateful (no pressure) if you decide to use my referral link here!\n\nDisclaimer : This is not financial advice, the information in this article is for educational purposes only.

I promise not to shill though, I'm just looking for a discussion!   \n\n\nWe are launching (in three weeks) a blockchain for decentralized capital markets. At the core of everything is an AMM that we have invented that infers virtual liquidity, no need for collateral or liquidity providers. The first application we are launching is a decentralized, independent stock exchange. Price discovery will happen from the beginning, on every asset from Tesla to Apple, entirely independent of existing centralized exchanges. This is the only way to overcome the regulatory problems with other approaches as well as the technical problems of using oracles.   \n\n\nWe have also built a Web2 interface and custodial wallet solution that lets mainstream users access it. We have the same game theory and mechanics as traditional markets, but many more participants (because everyone in the world can use it). This means that the markets on our chain can start to lead other more traditional exchanges. The other key aspect is that the L1 token for the chain also receives a portion of the trading fees on each of the protocols. It becomes an asset backed token and is sort of equivalent to owning a piece of the NYSE.  \n\n\nAny thoughts?

"how is chainlink still in the top 10? investors beware of this overpriced coin. i'm actually more qualified to talk about this than most redditors. i'm employed with a cyber-techno machinations company, i do a lot of security analyst programming type work. open source, decentralized, apis, partnerships, you name it. we'd be one of the first companies in line for something like chainlink, if the decentralized smart contract space had more value over traditional data exchanges. there is a catch though, an underlying flaw more deeply embedded in the bedrock of link than the very code itself. the flaw is with the concept, and it is this: companies won't actually go through the hassle of trusting their data api is through crypto.\n\nnow i can already hear your keyboards going frantic, but hear me out. /biz/ hates banks, and traditional data providers. but actual companies, businesses, and investors do not. there is an old saying you might have heard of: ""if it are not broke, don't fix it!"". the idea that any of our bosses would give us the go ahead if we approached them to put our companies valuable data in a smart contract on a cryptocurrency called chainlink, that they've never heard of, we'd be laughed out at best and fired on the spot at worst. we already have api data buyers and providers we trust.\n\n'but chainlink is trustless!' i hear you cry, but is that really a good thing? just listen to the sound of it. businesses don't want to spend millions of dollars on something that is trustless, they want something trustful. 'but the reputation system!', doesn't that defeat the whole point of your coin? if companies only trust nodes with high reputation, what is the difference between trusting banks and data providers that already have reputation, but in real life not on a computer screen.\n\nthe fact is, link is going to share the same fate as eth will. a lot of 'real world application' hype, with a lot of 'crypto world application' reality. only, this billion supply coin isn't going to come close to the $1k that etherum hit. happy gambling though anons.\n\nin fact, chainlink is the epitome of a multi-level and intelligent scam. there are only three or four people on the team, who have some of the most unimpressive resumes in the blockchain field. their testnet consisted of nothing more than a simple json parser, something that any college freshman could put together over a weekend. remember all of those ""projects"" during late 2017 that ended up being nothing more than vaporware? chainlink is one of them. somehow they've survived for two years, but i think that is due to the different approach they have taken. instead of hyping their coin, they've stayed extremely patient. they know that they can make more money from you over the course of a few years rather than weeks. i would be very cautious if you decided to buy chainlink, as it could very well be the worst decision you've ever made. the ceo of smartcontract (sergey nazarov), the founder of chainlink, holds a degree in sociology and a minor in religious studies. he is also worn the same shirt at every single conference for the past two years. is that really someone you want to trust with your money? don't fall for all of the technical terms used in this talk. those words mean nothing. the people in the crowd don't even know what he is talking about. the blockchain team leader at microsoft, chad o'fork, said this about chainlink in february 2018: ""while smartcontract and chainlink are interesting projects, i doubt there would be any real use-case in the future for such technology. companies do not like to put their data in the hands of anonymous node operators.""\n\n\n\ntl;dr: chainlink is worthless and built off hype and memes, way overpriced.",Negative,824

"which is better: buying top coins vs. buying btc &amp; eth - (a 6 years dca case study) inspired by [this post]( i built a script to analyse if you dca'd blindly in the top crypto coins vs. investing in btc &amp; eth vs investing only in btc since the beginning of 2015, how much would your total worth is. here are the results.\n\n**numbers &amp; assumptions:**\n\n* dcaing takes place every week, on 1st, 8th, 15th and 22th of every month starting from jan 1st 2015 and until july 6th 2021.\n* investments budget per week is $100.\n* the weekly investment is divided equally on the coins invested in.\n* this case study is ignoring stable coin investments. e.g.: investing in the top 5 coins means the top 5 coins excluding any stable coins.\n* the analysis is assuming that you invested your money and never sold any coin till now.\n* total invested money over the whole dca period is $31,300.\n* transaction fees are not included in the analysis.\n\n**here are the results:**\n\n* if you blindly dca into the top 1 coins (btc), you will end up with **$1,102,104**.\n* if you blindly dca into the top 2 coins, you will end up with 4 coins (btc, xrp, ltc, eth) in your wallet and total worth of **$1,462,443**.\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 3 coins**, you will end up with 11 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,310,552.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 5 coins**, you will end up with 23 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,490,189.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 7 coins**, you will end up with 37 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,923,849.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 10 coins**, you will end up with 55 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,316,169.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 20 coins**, you will end up with 130 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,619,756.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 50 coins**, you will end up with 381 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$979,086.**\n* if you had a glass ball and knew that eth will be what it is today and you invested only in btc &amp; eth, you will end up with 2 coins in your wallet (surprise), and a total worth of **$4,505,477.**\n\n**some observations:**\n\n1. although it was relatively easier to guess that btc will be the #1 crypto coin back then, nobody would have guessed for sure that eth will be #2, so betting on btc &amp; eth only from the beginning would've been your strategy only if you know the future. (you are god). based on that it is safer to say ""i invest in the top x coins"" instead of saying i only invest in coin x and coin y.\n2. investing in altcoins in addition to btc can increase your roi considerably. investing in top 7-10 coins tends to yield the most return in this case study (x3).\n3. based on #2, a crypto etf (or a similar service from exchanges that allow us to buy in bulk) could give exposure to the top x coins while saving transaction costs considerably.\n\nif you want more details, here is what your wallet would look like in each case of the above:\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ note:** this whole case study was a fun project and i was trying to answer some questions and thought to share it with you in case that would help you in any way. also it is important to not that history does not dictate the future, so please take all of what i present here with a grain of salt.\n\nmuch love!",Question,931

"would a trustless raffle be possible using cryptocurrency? hi. my friends have been raffling objects they made and donating the pooled money to charity. the way it works is people send them usd using venmo or paypal and then whoever set up the raffle donates that money that is being pooled to a charity. the issue is that to donate you have to trust that they won't pocket the money. this trust system limits who are comfortable participating in the raffle, in a sense the raffle can't expand beyond a close network of known people. would there be a way to set up a crypto wallet that people can send crypto to that can be audited by everyone? it would also be interesting if the wallet would automatically send the money to charity at a set date. in essence, a system that is programmed to pool the money, securely and transparently, and then send it to a charity without needing human input. \n\nthe potential resistance to using cryptocurrency for this is that i suspect most people participating in the raffles do not have much crypto experience. there are also transaction fees to consider as well as the issue of potentially having to convert the crypto to usd before donating it. it would be extra cool if the wallet can pick a raffle winner as well! using a stablecoin pegged to usd might be the way to go for this. if anybody has any ideas or suggestions i would appreciate it!",Question,292

"Can we use DeXs in India to convert to INR using P2P thus avoiding the 30% crypto tax?I've been reading crypto tax and ways to circumvent it. I feel we should NOT give in to the 30% crypto tax. Protests starts from first NOT abiding by those laws forcing govt to make crypto friendly laws for everyone.\n\nI work as a freelancer and receive my payments (generally &lt; $500) in a single transaction using crypto. I used to receive it on Binance (a CeX) but now I think I should receive it on a DeX. I was thinking of going the route suggested by u/throwawaycryptotown of using a DeX and not reporting the gains to the government. I already use trust wallet and pancakeswap for swapping sometimes.\n\nI have 4 questions:\n\n1. I was thinking of using DyDx or pancakeswap. So I can technically receive all of that $500 on a DeX, not report that income or any further profits I make on it. But if I want to convert it to INR, does DeXs support P2P? How wud I get INR in my bank let's say after an year or two.\n\n2. If I use DeXs, then they mostly support normal spot trading. I like to do Futures trading. So if I use DeXs, I'll have to give that up? I saw pancakeswap.finance has a new domain as perp.pancakeswap.finance which supports perpetual trading but it does not support trust wallet. It has wallet connect support.\n\n3. \n\n3.1 CeXs like Binance provide hefty APYs of about 50% on a whole variety of coins but DeXs doesn't seem to do so except that farm/pool of that particular coin. I can't stake any other coin like USDT on pancakeswap or I wud have to do it using a USDT + Cake farm.\n\n3.2 Also, to stake or use a farm on pancakeswap (let's say the farm of Cake-BUSD or DOT-BNB or Link-BNB), I wud have to get BNB or Cake or Dot or Link ONLY OVER BEP20 to my trust wallet? Is this understanding correct? I faced an issue earlier where I transferred USDT over TRC20 and pancakeswap was showing my USDT balance as 0. So FOR ANY coin on pancakeswap, if I get it on BEP20, pancakeswap will allow me to use it for farms/pools? When I open Trust wallet, I can see the BNB and Cake over BEP20 but Dot or Link doesn't show any network. Is it by default BEP20? If I want to use Dot-BNB farm on pancakeswap, how should I get Dot in my trust wallet such that it shows as non-zero balance on pancakeswap?\n\n4. Also which wallet wud u recommend out of Trust wallet or binance wallet (not metamask due to huge fees). I am more inclined towards Trust wallet because I already am using it but if BSC wallet has more benefits, pls enlighten me.\n\nWhat should be the right way to go about it? Can u suggest any DeXs along with wallets which meets all the above criteria. Wud be really grateful for ur time and advice.",Question,710

"Crypto DEX Futures on pancakeswapTLDR help understanding how to set things up in pancakeswap futures for no tax issues.\n\nHello, am very new to the crypto space.\n\nI have been active in traditional F&amp;O in Indian markets but was attracted by the huge leverage in crypto futures.\n\nHad questions as to how to get things set up to avoid any issues with tax as well as save some money on tax. \n\nI was wanting to use metamask / go the dex route so that I only have to pay the 30% tax on NET profits on crypto and not on every profitable trade on crypto futures, wherein I wouldn't be able to offset losses. \n\nI was thinking of pancakeswap over dydx as it has more leverage ( I have played with heavy leverage b4, can manage it with stoploss etc. )\n\nWas planning to do this:\n\n1. Buy usdt on Binance (kyc required, ok with that)\n2. Turn usdt into BNB on Binance\n3. Transfer BNB using metamask to Pancakeswap ( runs on binance smart chain )\n4. Convert to whichever currency one can trade perpetual futures with on pancakeswap\n5. Make money !!! ! ! !\n6. Convert profits to BNB on pancakeswap\n7. Transfer BNB to Binance\n8. Withdraw funds to INR bank account\n9. Pay 30% tax on NET profit ( which my understanding is that one can't do on a cex like delta exchange because the govt. can ask it for data and one has to pay 30% tax on all profitable transactions )\n\nDoes this plan sound ok ?\n\nIf anyone knows, how much will this whole process cost ? As in if I have 1000 INR in my hand, till the time it gets to pancakeswap, how much will remain for trading futures after all the transaction fees of binance + metamask etc. ?\n\nI plan to trade with little money to begin with maybe 10k over a week, but still I don't want to mess things up because I didn't think thru. something.\n\nAlso, any reviews on pancakeswap futures would be great as there is very little info available online.\n\nIs it better than delta exchange futures, for example ?

"anchor protocol hey folk,\n\nfirst things first. i'm fairly new to the crypto scene as well as to reddit as a network to have a discussion on. so please excuse my clumsy choice of words, if i'm using wrong terms in the following.\n\ni recently stumbled over the anchor protocol of the terra network, which offers various ways to invest money. even so i'm very impressed with the project is idea, the names of the team and the amount of people already involved, i still have some doubts about how safe it is, to put my money there.\n\nso as one of various options to stake your money (i will only talk about this one for now), the anchor protocol claims to guarantee 20 apr on the amount of ust that is being deposited. this sound like a crazy good deal regarding the aprs you would currently receive at a bank (at least here in germany) which would be around 0.5 to 1.0 apr. so the question that springs to mind is, how is that even possible? are there any catches?\n\nso i tried to do a little digging (reddit, youtube, google etc.). sadly, none of what i found truly explained where the value was created in order to guarantee this 20 apr. most of the posts took the 20% as good given or explained it with oversimplified examples that would just relocate the question about the creation of value to another part of the example.\n\nto be fair, i was overstrained reading the white papers, since i m not familiar with it-terms, as i never got in touch with programming too much. so maybe everything is laid out there and i'm just too stupid to understand it.\n\nanyhow, the little bit if research i did today as well as the examples posted gave me the impression that the 20 apr is only working as long as the network is growing and we are moving in a bulls market. as i said before, i don't want to imply anything here, i just really hope, someone can give me a little deeply insight to understand the system.\n\nso here is the given example that supposedly explains, how 20 apr can be maintained:\n\nfirst of all, its presumed that stacked ust can generate a yield of 10-12 apr (even tho i have no idea if that is realistic, i just assume its true since i see how stacking generates value by verifying transactions)\n\n1. leo deposits 100 $, expects 20 apr = 20 $ for the year\n2. bob wants to borrow 100 $, so he puts down 300 $ dollar as collateral in order to take leo is 100 $ as a loan\n3. the anchor protocol stakes bob#s 300 $ collateral to gain 30 $ ( 10 apr on 300 $)\n4. from this staking earning (30 $), 20 $ go into leo is pocket for providing the 100 $ loan, the other 10 $ go into some type of pool of the network\n\nso why would you lock up 300 $ as collateral in order to loan 100 $. why not work with 100 $ of the 300 $ of your own in the first place? since the collateral deposited is locked in stacking, you don't get the 100 $ on top of your 300 $ to work with but instead.\n\nsince this doesn't make sense, i tried to figure out why people would loan from the depositors of ust. so apparently if you post bluna as collateral, you get rewarded which anchor token with insane apr up to 250% (the youtube video was from march this year). on top of that, you can loan money as states in the example before in order to add it to the collateral value already put down, leading to a bigger amount rewarded with the 250 apr.\n\nto amplify the example before:\n\n5. bob gets 250 apr in anchor tokens for his 300 $ put down in collateral.\n\n6. he also get 250 apr on the 100 $ loaned from leo. therefore he does not mind to pay 30% interest on the 100 $ loaned (10% stacking reward on the 300 $ put down as collateral) since he is still making good profit with 220 apr on the loaned money.\n\nthis leads to the next and even more urgent question. are these 250% legit?\n\napparently the apr on the collateral value is flexibel, depending on the amount of collateral value as well as the demand for it.\n\nso right now the value of an anchor token sits at around 5 dollars. if the prices stays the same, even with more and more value being put down as collateral, the apr in put down collateral value will dip but not go anywhere near 30 apr in the foreseeable future. if demand for the anchor token goes up, the apr might even rise. so for those scenarios, system keeps going.\n\nquestion is: what happens if the value of anchor token goes down? since the generated anchor token reward is self compounding and therefor put down as collateral value right away in order to general more anchor token, the ""value"" never really leaves the eco-system of the terra-network. i see the temptation of just putting all the profit right back in the collateral value, since 250% is simply too good to not throw all money spare money you have at it.\n\nbut what happens if someone actually started to cash out? i assume the price of anchor token would drop due to a drop in demand, the apr for collateral value would drop, therefore more people would get out, the value of anchor would drop even more, collateral loaned will be liquidated which all will eventually lead to a downward spiral.\n\nit looks like the whole thing could go south pretty quickly, once rolling.\n\nso this leads me to the final question where i want to leave it for now and see if anyone has some more information on this topic.\n\nwhat is the actual value of anchor and how stable is its value?\n\nsince its supposed to carry interest at 250 apr, is there any more value to it, other than being automatically reinvested as collateral value in order to general even more anchor? it seem that other the staking for interest you can also stake anchor tokens in order to participate in votes of the terra network community.\n\nso this does not quite cut it for me in order to put my money here. the vote option aside. i don't see any value in anchor other than that it might be stacked in order to get more value. the whole system stops working, once the price of anchor drops and people cash out. everyone not fast enough will lose money or even get liquidated. since we're in a bull market and the ""auto compounding"" is very convenient, i don't see this happening anytime soon, but i guess it will eventually happen.\n\ni don't know if i'm making any mistakes here, if i'm giving in to any misconception or if everyone else is just blinded by the $$-signs. as i said before. the network and community itself seems so vivid that i really want to participate. but at the same time, most communication stops at a rather superficial level while everything for the team itself is the hard to understand with any it-background.\n\nlooking forward to hear your thoughts on the topic.",Question,1529

"if this ""dip"" is scaring you, you're probably too overleveraged. but don't worry too much, this is just part of the overall cycle. remember when we were sub $30k in late july? everyone was calling the end of the bull run.\n\nsince then we once again broke new ath is pretty much across the board with ease.\n\ni know there is a lot of newer people getting involved in the space and it is a lot of fun when the numbers seemingly only go up but this market is insanely cyclical. the numbers never just keep going up forever and sometimes you buy in right at the perfect spot for whales to liquidate and buy up at a cheaper price.\n\nalso if you are new, please do not mess with options and leverage unless you seriously know what you're doing. the prices in crypto can crash and moon on seemingly nothing, regardless of positive or negative news, and sometimes literally nothing. it is a total crap shoot and you can get liquidated (just like the $52 million just in btc) did in the last two days.\n\nbut at the same time if you are in the red because you bought at or near the top, please don't worry. this shit is just another tuesday in the space and the market will go back to breaking ath is at least until early 2022 (my opinion) and maybe even longer.\n\nuse this time to research your coin investments and read up on the technicals. determine if the risk you are carrying is worth it, yes if you have all your money in risky shitcoins you may see huge returns fast, but remember those investments can crash and burn harder and faster than say a majority investment in btc or eth.\n\ngood luck everyone and have fun on the ride!",Positive,370

"TOP COINS THAT SURVIVED CRYPTO CRASH-2022 \n\nAre you wondering about the crypto crash and the coins that survived the major crash? The majority of the most valuable crypto coin have lost as much as 40% of their value in the last few weeks, which has caused the cryptocurrency market to experience some turbulence. This also covers digital currencies like Terra, Ethereum, and Bitcoin.\n\nThe main cause of the gloomy feeling in the cryptocurrency market is fear. Crypto investors panicked and started selling other coins as well as Terra as it plummeted, ultimately destroying the cryptocurrency industry. Few cryptocurrencies are hanging by a thread in this severe bear market and may not make it out alive. But for present, there are some encouraging signals for the bitcoin sector. The top 7 cryptocurrencies that could survive a cryptocurrency market crash listed in this article.\n\nTop 7 Crypto Coins\n\n**Litecoin**\n\nBy former Google engineer Charles ?Charlie? Lee in October 2011, Litecoin emerged as a competing cryptocurrency. The open-source code of Bitcoin used to create Litecoin, but changes made. The foundation of Litecoin is the same as that of Bitcoin: an open-source, decentralised global payment network. The adoption of Script as a proof-of-work algorithm and the quicker block creation rate are two ways that Litecoin differentiates from Bitcoin.\n\n**Polygon Matic**\n\nThe Polygon platform connects Ethereum-based projects and runs on the Ethereum blockchain. While maintaining the security, interoperability, and structural advantages of the Ethereum blockchain, using the Polygon platform can boost the flexibility, scalability, and sovereignty of a blockchain enterprise.\n\nSince MATIC is an ERC-20 token, it can used with other cryptocurrencies based on the Ethereum platform.\n\n**Dogecoin**\n\nThe first meme coin to ever join the cryptocurrency market was Dogecoin (DOGE). Dogecoin initially invented as a joke. However, it appears that the adorable dog won over a lot of people because Dogecoin immediately took off and joined the ranks of the crypto heavyweights. Elon Musk, a fintech expert, frequently tweets about his support for Dogecoin (DOGE). Every time he tweets, Dogecoin is seen by his 50 million Twitter followers, who seize the chance to buy the cryptocurrency, driving up its price.\n\n**Shiba Inu**\n\nRyoshi, a nondescript creator, was the brains behind Shiba Inu (SHIB). Despite being created to parody Dogecoin, it immediately became popular on its own. They are currently both among the top 20 most valuable cryptocurrencies. Shiba Inu is also experiencing growth. At the time of writing, it had gone up 1.785 percent in the previous 24 hours\n\n**Solana**\n\nDecentralized financial (Defi) solutions are offered by the fully functional open-source project Solana, which relies on the permissionlessness of blockchain technology. Although the project?s conception and preliminary work started in 2017, the Solana Foundation, which has its main office in Geneva, Switzerland, formally launched Solana in March of that year. There are 319,790,577 SOL coins in circulation, and the maximum supply is not known.\n\n**Cardano**\n\nCardano was established in 2017 and was given its name in honour of the Italian polymath Gerolamo Cardano. The 19th-century mathematician Ada Lovelace, widely considered as the first computer programmer, is the inspiration behind the naming of the native ADA token. It has a maximum supply of 45,000,000,000 ADA coins and a circulating circulation of 33,626,396,776 ADA coins.\n\n**Avalanche**\n\nA layer one blockchain called Avalanche serves as a foundation for decentralised applications and private blockchain networks. One of Ethereum?s competitors, it seeks to dethrone Ethereum as the most widely used blockchain for smart contracts. By having a larger transaction output of up to 6,500 transactions per second without sacrificing scalability, it seeks to achieve this. There are 245,532,531 AVAX coins in circulation, and the maximum supply is not known.\n\nCryptocurrency cannot be eradicated since it was created to be disruptive and usher in a new financial era. Cryptocurrencies won?t come to an end during a bear market brought on by the waxing and waning of conventional macro cycles. Even while some people might lose money, some would HODL, and some might even buy more, cryptocurrency will rebound. For investors, it?s merely a chance to purchase more.",Miscellaneous,957

"pro tip: dont buy the ""easy"" way! hello, just wanted to give the community a heads up when buying their crypto. this psa is about getting more crypto for your buck. it may seem like a small savings, but it could be a lot of money over the years buying the ""easy"" way.\n\nfor example, on some exchanges when you buy a token directly, they charge a random fee that can be from $1 to some crazy percentage like +4%. not only are you paying that fee, but most likely you are buying the token well over market price. i have seen some mark it a baffling 10% over market price, absolutely disgusting way to take customers money imo. at least let us know how much you are gonna screw us on the mark-up. \n\nanyway, there is a way around these fees. for most exchanges you buy directly, you can also trade on order books. for example, coinbase also has coinbase pro (binanceus, kraken, okcoin are others, not trying to hype cb) where you can instead deposit usd for free or a very small fee, then trade it for your token and pay a takers fee of around **0.5% or less**. \n\nspot trading also let is you buy the coin at market price and pay a very reasonable fee, saving you so much on fees over time. if this is something new to you, i encourage you to try and learn how to buy/sell from order books. it is very easy to use, the hard part is if you are making the right choice buying/selling.\n\ntl;dr: if you want a fair price, always try to buy straight from order books if you can. every other way is ripping you off.",Neutral sentiment,370

The changes only require new hash input\n\n**Motivation**\n\nTo save energy because, you know, Elon\n\n**Proposal**\n\nIn addition, the existing block hash, a tweet will be added from twitter as random text to the hash input strings. To ensure that a person cannot game the system, it is suggested to use tweets from the people of the likes of Elon Musk or Donald Trump, because neither is predictable, nor make any sense, nor are they even consistent with their own previous statements, they donï¿½t even know what theyï¿½ll tweet next, therefore making it impossible for them to cheat the system. \n\nIn a typical day they spit out a random tweet around every 5 minutes, making in perfectly aligned with the bitcoin blockchain. In the event a tweet from them is unavailable , a new butt shot from Kim Kardashian will be used. Other sources of gibberish include Gretta Thunberg, the random sounds of Amber Heard hitting and screaming at her boyfriend, not to mention whatever shit Ellen does off set to her crew\n\nMiners will only be able to mine when two tweets (or other data) are received in any 10 minute period, meaning they will be unable to mine until the ï¿½random bullshit tweetsï¿½ are included into the hash input, so there will be more idle time where it's impossible for them to mine\n\nRisk\n\nThe main risk is the tweets and content from Elon, Trump, Kim, et al will need to be included in blocks. This is unacceptable, so for the benefit of the world, it's totally worth the extra cost to the environment to ensure these tweets don't end up in the blockchain. Therefore the authors suggest miners do what theyï¿½ve been doing and purchase green energy and invest where they can in new green energy sources",Neutral sentiment,459

"how i got into crypto just curious to know what everyone is story on how they got interested in looking deeper into crypto currencies, blockchains and nfts.\n\nfor me it was back in 2011 and i was addicted to this korean style mmorpg online game as a freshman in high school. i don't remember what got me into the game but it was highly addicting. my parents unfortunately never wanted me to purchase things in the game that had to do with real money. it was sort of a play to win type of game and i wanted to be super op but in order to do so i had to purchase things with real money. as a freshman in high school with no job and no money, i begged my parents to get this one thing for me but still they said no. i didn't give up though. i did google searches on how i can get these specific items for free and someone suggested bitcoin on the game is forum. just get some bitcoin, convert that into in game currency, and booya i get insane stat boosted armor. my dad decided to help me out with this venture and we looked into how we could get bitcoin and saw that ebay users were selling bitcoin for ""i think"" $80 a coin. but after thorough research my dad and i found that ""mining"" was another way to get free bitcoin. there were already great youtube tutorials on how mining can be done, but i had a super crappy laptop so there was no way i could mine on such a thing and my parents would never get me a $500 graphic card and computer. at the time, my dad and i also calculated the amount of bitcoin we would earn along with how much electricity would be used and in the end we would be losing money by like $0.50. so in the long run, it might've been worth it if someone was psychic but in our case, we might as well just buy that insane stat boosting armor. we gave up on this venture and my dad said ""fuck it, how much is the armor?"".\n\nmy dad and i did some great research and never really touched it again until the beginning of this year. but in the end, i learned a lot about bitcoin and mining and still do remember those specific things that i learned today because of how interesting it was. the best of all, i got my insane stat boosting armor but unfortunately i stopped playing the game after a couple months.",Neutral sentiment,497

(1) you buy $100 worth of btc directly. (2) you buy $100 worth of usdc, wait for a dip, and then exchange all of your usdc for btc, minus a few bucks in fees. \n* **are there taxes involved in sending and/or receiving crypto between different wallets owned by the same person?**\n * my current wallet of exodus, but since it only allows you to buy btc directly, i have been also using coinbase to buy other types of crypto, which i then send to my exodus wallet. in addition to whatever taxes i have to pay on the buying/holding said crypto in coinbase, am i also paying taxes on sending this crypto to my exodus wallet? in short, is this strategy ill-advised or just fine?\n* **is there an optimal buying/holding/selling/exchanging/sending strategy from a tax perspective?** \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nthank you in advance for your responses!",Neutral sentiment,603

"Dutch Financial Markets Authority survey: half crypto investors see it as a gamble The majority of the 1.2 million Dutch crypto investors seem to be aware of the risks involved in investing in crypto currencies. Almost half have only put in a maximum of 500 euros. There is also a group that gets into serious trouble if the price drops. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis concerns a group of about 100,000 consumers, calculates regulator Authority for the Financial Markets [based on a survey by Ipsos](https://www.afm.nl/~/profmedia/files/nieuws/2021/attitudes-van-cryptobezitters.pdf?la=nl-nl). If 90 percent of the value of their crypto were to evaporate in a month, they would have a financial problem that they would not be able to absorb, or only with great difficulty. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA 90 percent drop in value, by the way, is extreme, says the AFM. The authority regularly warns of the dangers of investing in crypto currencies because they do not fall under their supervision. This increases the risk of unsuspecting investors putting their money in a pyramid scheme disguised as a crypto currency. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother major risk for investors is the violent price fluctuations. The largest crypto, bitcoin, went from a price of about $30,000 (26,600 euros) this year to well over double that, collapsed again to below 30,000, climbed to a record high of $69,000 and has now fallen again by about 30 percent to $50,000 value. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Less return, also less stress**\n\nBy the way, the stock price is still 73 percent higher than on January 1 of this year. By comparison, the AEX is about 28 percent higher, but the price of the main Dutch stock market index went up and down a lot less. The moment at which someone decided to invest, therefore, mattered less and the chance of losing (part of) your deposit is also smaller if you suddenly need the money. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInvestors also do take into account a crash in the price of crypto currencies. Of all the risks surrounding cryptos, this one tops the list, followed by losing the investment due to theft, scams or the bankruptcy of an exchange or crypto exchange. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen assessing risk, it is notable that those who also invest in things other than just cryptos are a lot more pessimistic than those who have put all their cards on cryptos.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Small amounts**\n\nThe latter group, on the other hand, is a bit more cautious about how much money they put in. More than half of the group that only invests in cryptos, only invests with an amount of up to 500 euros. This may also have to do with the fact that relatively many young people invest in cryptos, and they have even less to spend. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAmong those who invest not only in cryptos but also in stocks, for example, the group that invests only such a relatively small amount is a lot smaller. Almost a third invest for a maximum of 500 euros, 35 percent are in it for an amount of at least 2,500 euros.",Objective,737

"crypto tax software bug my name is sung hwang. i wanted to share my negative experience with [cryptotrader.tax]( i think [t]( company changed its name to coinledger. in short, it is about two defects, bugs, i found in their tax software in 2021. \n\n	in 2021, i used their free version online tax calculation service. i found two bugs in their software. i can say conclusively that i found bugs in their tax software because i notified them by email about the bugs and later they emailed me back and acknowledged the bugs. \n\n	here were the two bugs. 1. their software processed some of my coin purchases as income. it would have raised my tax because having crypto income means i had to pay income tax. 2. their software did not add some of my coin selling fees to the cost basis. so, that also would've raised my tax. \n\n	i understand software have bugs. although it took two months, they eventually fixed the bugs as far as i can tell. but here is the problem, by the time the bugs were supposedly fixed, it was august 2021, 4 months after the regular tax season was over. there had to many people who were affected by their software and paid more tax than they had to as a result. despite my repeated request to the company, they seemed to be refusing to notify their customers who were affected by the bugs. here is my detailed email exchanges with them. \n\n	in august 2021, after they asked me to test their software again to confirm the bugs were fixed. i think it worked correctly. then i emailed them asking them if they were going to notify their affected customers about the bugs. and here is what they wrote in their reply email on aug 27, 2021, 11:01 am\n\n""i appreciate the concern here and yes, we do plan to notify our customers so that they can re-import their data for kraken. we follow a standard practice for this in which our dev team runs an affected user analysis and then we will send an outreach by email to all the affected users. we are committed to addressing any errors and helping our customers to get the correct calculations. thank you for reaching out about this issue and for providing evidence that made it very easy to escalate and then resolve the bug. please let me know if you have any more feedback or concerns that i can share with our team.""\n\n	right away, i replied asking when they were going to send out the notification. and here is what they wrote in the reply email on sep 6, 2021, 11:52 am\n\n	""thanks for following up in this. our engineers are running a query in the production database to determine all the affected users, and then our david, our ceo will be sending out a message. this should be completed by the end of this week. the good news is that based on the the initial survey from our integrations team, this bug was detected pretty early and only affects a fraction of kraken users. i'll be sure to message you directly once the email has gone out.""\n\n	one month later, i emailed asking for an update. they replied as below on sep 28, 2021, 9:47 am\n\n	""thanks for checking in about this. it has taken a bit longer than expected to run the query in our production database as we want to extra thorough in collecting all affected users. we should have this completed within the next week. feel free to send another follow up message if you do not hear from me.""\n\n	that was the last email i received from them. i emailed them in october, again in november asking for an update. no more replies. nothing. which leads me to believe they are not going to notify their affected customers who might have paid more tax than they had to due to their software bugs.",Neutral sentiment,809

History tells us that the 200 Week SMA is where Bitcoin Bottoms Out. Hence, the first reason is the 200 Week SMA and our price target is $14,000.\n\nSecondly, on the Bitcoin 6 Months chart, we see that we have closed the last candle about 5 days back and it was a shooting star candle. Shooting star candlesticks are found at the top of an uptrend. This indicates that we might be in a correction phase for the the next 1 to 2 candles which is about 6 to 12 months. On inspecting the first level of support on this chart we see that it is down to $14,000 which becomes our price target.\n\nLastly, on the Bitcoin 5 days chart, we plot the Gaussian Channel. History tells us that when ever we go below the bottom line of the Gaussian Channel, we tend to correct by approximately 50%. Therefore, a 50% correction from the current bottom of the Gaussian Channel takes us to about $14,000.",Miscellaneous,267

Welcome to the fourth week of the **CRYPTO FANTASY LEAGUE** called **MOONLEAGUE.** \n\nOnce again, you can read the rules here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m0ceaa/if\_crypto\_was\_a\_sport\_league\_and\_coins\_a\_team/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m0ceaa/if_crypto_was_a_sport_league_and_coins_a_team/)\n\nThe results from **GAME WEEK 3** are here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mft6nn/week\_3\_crypto\_fantasy\_league\_game\_week\_3\_results/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mft6nn/week_3_crypto_fantasy_league_game_week_3_results/)\n\nAltcoin season is here! Many teams could enjoy this week as almost all teams gained some valuable points. Growth points are here, and this season is getting spicy. There was some serious movement, and a couple of interesting results. \n\nBefore I present the results, here is also one important update, in the next week I will work on a subreddit called: Moonleague. Everybody who wants to follow the results or share some info during game week you are free to do so. Once the subreddit is ready I will inform you with a post. \n\nHere are the GAME WEEK 4 results: \n\n**Crypto.com vs. Cosmos**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s9ez93elm5r61.png?width=483&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4277a8497e883f484d372b8fca973cf636fdc725\n\nThis was a tight game. Crypto.com gained some valuable points this week with Visa piloting the capability with Crypto.com. Cosmos was also pretty active, as they launched IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication), and that are good news for the team. They have managed to get some nice growth points but it was a close battle, and Crypto.com took the victory this week \n\n**Tether vs. Uniswap**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/80wp9afom5r61.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56a621cc22fe099dcad72b956869a4bdb3b24d43\n\nMystery didnâ€™t help Tether this week. With news that they are backed by undisclosed reserves, well that brought them just a slight growth rate, still enough to grab at least a point. Some may arguing that Uniswap is to centralized, but nonetheless, Uniswap managed to get a good amount of points this week with a pretty looking growth rate. \n\n**XRP vs. Bitcoin Cash**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ubz1hncqm5r61.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57517d0ba96cf64fd66bb582a5c7747fd2948555\n\nXRP and SEC, what a love story that is this year. XRP is now worth more today than before the SEC lawsuit, interesting! This week they are back on track, even though they lost this match, they will be happy to grab some valuable points. \n\n**Ethereum vs. NEM**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/apbr45zrm5r61.png?width=483&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12bdf781bdcb06dae4d032da1133ceac47bb863e\n\nThis week was a good one. Ethereum fans are happy and they finally played a great game and managed to achieve massive gains this week. Ethereum is looking to extend this form also next week and keep on hoping that April is the start of the Altcoin season that everybody was waiting for. NEM didnâ€™t had any chance this week, but at least they managed to get some growth points out of this, they still need a miracle in the next weeks to stand a chance for a decent spot in the league. \n\n**Binance Coin vs. USD Coin** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xt690mwtm5r61.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0120510bddb533ff55fc1046afb4f3412330dda1\n\nBinance did a fantastic job this week, and they pulled out a wonderful growth rate, making them a serious contender for a play-off spot. USD Coin is just grabbing some tiny but important points, and with VISA onboard they are looking to perform even better in the next weeks. \n\n**Aave vs. Litecoin**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/esv6sflvm5r61.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7b27bd1c39e92510e77dc7ed5eebaa178abb19b\n\nAave announced that they are working with Polygon to bypass Enthereum congestion, and that reflected positively, they finally had a good week and the entire team is now keen to keep pushing further. Litecoin is now available over PayPal, this was not enough for a victory, but they will be happy to take some points and hoping for a good next game week. \n\n**Cardano vs. Dogecoin**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1k94c7zxm5r61.png?width=483&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd3ebc9e0324be39224570c826fe8506d16abf25\n\nCardano was one of two teams that had a negative rate this week, and the large ADA community is certainly not happy about it. Dogecoin and Elon are in love again, with plans to get them on the moon. In the moonleague, Dogecoin still needs to push a bit harder if they want to get that Moon, still it was a good week and the managed to get some points and a win out of this. \n\n**Bitcoin vs. Stellar** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mdsjiggzm5r61.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33c1ad6783f1ae10bc01670e52d5f4f2d82da59d\n\nBitcoin was still able to get some points this week, after a long time they are not in the spotlight, they still managed to get some points here and they will be happy about it. Stellar finally did a good job. After a disappointed start, they grabbed a important win here with a healthy and good looking growth rate. \n\n**THETA vs. VeChain**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t515fe11n5r61.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=363644fbc4eaad8a2bf4bfb1867040690115c210\n\nTHETA is the dark horse of this competition, and this week the bull run is put on a hold, they lost the game and they lost some points, they will be happy not to lose much here and it wonâ€™t affect them in terms of their position in the Moonleague. VeChain won, and they it was barely a positive outcome. They will be sad, as they didnâ€™t make the best out of this week, especially with THETA generating some minuses. \n\n**Chainlink vs. Polkadot**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kuzc9523n5r61.png?width=483&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3087c856c38f9a80c8e3093b9d68ff171ee636bc\n\nChainlink released native substrate module to bring its oracles to Polkadot, and that helped them achieve a nice growth rate, but Polkadot took the upper hand with this week news, making them almost unstoppable this week. We can now say with confidence that Polkadot is back in the game! Great performance from both teams, unfortunate that they played against each other this week, considering the news that both teams announced this week. \n\n**LEAGUE TABLE after GAME WEEK 4**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fd1486iim5r61.png?width=1072&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a816a17dc156a360cc4eb82d7b39802170c51e1\n\nThere was a lot of movement in the league table this week. We got some new entries into the playoff spot. THETA is still leading the way with a huge gap between them and the second placed VeChain. Mid-table is really interesting with 5 teams having the same amount of points. Other teams are still able to pull of a surprise, Polkadot showed what a good game week can do, as they jumped straight into a playoff sport this week. NEM is still looking bad, and the team needs to start performing if they want to make something out of this season. \n\n**BIGGEST GAINER: POLKADOT â€“** 11 position up  \n\n**BIGGEST DROP: TETHER â€“** 6 positions down \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PERFOMER OF THE WEEK:** \n\n**POLKADOT:** They had the biggest growth rate this week: 36,41%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**UNDERPERFOMER OF THE WEEK:** \n\n**THETA:** They had a negative rate of: -6,75% \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**GAME WEEK 5 FIXTURES:** \n\nGAME 1: THETA (1) vs. Crypto.com (5)\n\nGAME 2: VeChain (2) vs. Bitcoin (6)\n\nGAME 3: Binance Coin (3) vs. Cardano (8)\n\nGAME 4: Tether (13) vs. XRP (9)\n\nGAME 5: Litecoin (10) vs  Chainlink (11)\n\nGAME 6: Cosmos (15) vs USD Coin (16)\n\nGAME 7: Ethereum (7) vs. Uniswap (17)\n\nGAME 8: Bitcoin Cash (14) vs. Polkadot (5)\n\nGAME 9: Stellar (18) vs. Aave (19)\n\nGAME 10: NEM (20) vs. Dogecoin (12)",Noise,2438

"introducing payments and transactions - how cryptocurrency blockchains work in the simplest terms. bitcoin is a digital currency, with â€œcoinâ€ in its name, and the original white paper describes it as electronic â€œcashâ€ and mentions â€œwallets.â€ so people may assume when payments are made, coins move from address to address, from wallet to wallet. this is not at all how bitcoin works, the coins and wallets analogy is just that, an analogy.\n\n###how cryptocurrency blockchains actually work\n\nsuppose alice wants to send one bitcoin (btc) to bob\n\n- first she composes a new â€˜transaction messageâ€™ which reference the funds in her â€˜walletâ€™. these funds are composed of a combination of some of her previous transactions. these are known as the â€˜inputsâ€™. the sum of the inputs must total exactly or almost invariably more than the amount (due to fees), the amount she wants to send to bob. \n\n- she must also note the address or public key to which she wants to send funds. these are called â€˜outputsâ€™. she signs the â€˜transaction messageâ€™ with her private keys corresponding to the input addresses and broadcasts it on the peer-to-peer network. \n\n- itâ€™s unlikely that alice will have a single prior transaction that she can use to pay bob (i.e. 1.01 btc, exactly one bitcoin plus the appropriate mining fee). more likely she will have many different possible â€˜unspent outputsâ€™ to choose from 0.87 - 0.34 - 1.15 - 3.5 - 0.02 - 0.001 - to make a payment she must combine these funds in such a way that she makes the correct payment to bob. \n\n- so, she could use one big input (like the one for 3.5 bitcoins) and get change of 2.49 bitcoins back by including a second output for that amount to an address that she controls. the transaction would now have one input and two outputs.\n\n- alternatively she could use two small inputs (like the ones for 0.87 and 0.34) but still want change (i.e. 0.2) for which she would provide a change address. that transaction would therefore have two inputs and two outputs.\n\n- if all goes well, a â€˜minerâ€™ will include the transaction in the next block after verifying that the inputs and signatures are valid. the transaction is now complete and bob can now reference this completed transaction as an input into a future transaction when he wants to move his funds.\n\nthe key thing to realize is that there are no individual, atomic units of bitcoin that are transferred among addresses. what individuals â€œownâ€ are not bitcoins, but unspent transaction outputs (utxos) that can serve as inputs for new transactions.\n\n###why is this important to understand? not your â€˜keysâ€™ not your â€˜walletâ€™!\n\nbecause it is not possible to track individual units of bitcoin, many legal questions of criminal activity and regulation (notably taxable events) are raised. governments, law enforcement or criminals, can not track individual coins and instead concentrate on â€˜walletâ€™ addresses. when interacting with cryptocurrency blockchains - the addresses are the â€˜keysâ€™, literally and metaphorically, to ownership, security and privacy.\n\n###tl;dr there is no such thing as a â€˜bitcoinâ€™. you do not store â€˜coinsâ€™ in a â€˜walletâ€™ - you keep a reference to records of your unspent transactions as a public key on the blockchain, which only your private key allow you to access (the crypto in cryptocurrency). any payments and receipts, are updated as inputs and outputs, whose values, addresses and signatures are validated and verified by miners with the minting of new blocks, and secured onto the blockchain.\n\n(any suggestions with wording or accuracy appreciated).\n\n[.]( key information is sourced from an original article by jerry brito, coin center",Neutral sentiment,888

Many questions to be answered in clear here. Is it okay when 90% of mining power in Bitcoin [can gather in one room](https://twitter.com/lopp/status/673398201307664384)? Is it okay when 2 or 3 mining pools control majority of hashing power, so can do censorship? Is it okay when almost all the new nodes avoid processing a blockchain from its genesis block? Is it okay when a Proof-of-Work coin developers are doing a hard-fork changing the consensus algorithm to make it GPU-friendly again? Can we summarize all the issues with decentralization? Can we cover most of issues with technical means?Decentralization is about many issues lying in many fields, of technical, social, and hybrid kinds. Researchers and developers are trying to find technical solutions, preferably, elegant and efficient. However, for many issues such solutions are not known, thus social solutions are also needed.In this article I will cover only technical aspects of decentralization, namely, decentralization of mining and decentralization of verification.## Decentralization of MiningThe two biggest concerns about decentralization of mining are specialized hardware (such as ASICs) and centralized pools.With ASICs, a big player capable to invest enough money into R;D can get unfair advantage from privately owned efficient hardware. In principle, for any kind of computational activity it is always possible to develop specialized hardware performing better than commodity computing units, such and CPUs and GPUs. However, for different computational tasks R;D efforts and possible outcome could vary a lot. Reasoning behind a search for a perfect (or close enough to perfect) could be quite complex (see e.g. 30 pages long [Equihash paper](http://ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger/article/view/48)).For most of Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies (including Bitcoin, Ethereum, ZCash), 2 to 4 centralized mining pools  control majority of mining power. This could mean easy censorship or frontrunning on applications (for example, reordering exchange orders), as in centralized pools only pool decides block candidate for the whole pool to work on. As a possible outcome, non-outsourceable mining schemes can prevent centralized pools formation. Only [Ergo Platform](https://ergoplatform.org/en/) is known for deploying a practical non-outsourceable Proof-of-Work scheme (based on a supposedly memory-harder problem from the [Equihash paper](http://ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger/article/view/48)) called [Autolykos](https://docs.ergoplatform.com/ErgoPow.pdf).As an example where social decentralization issues meet the decentralization of mining, sometimes developers of Proof-of-Work are introducing hard-forks to make a Proof-of-Work algorithm GPU-friendly again once ASICs are going to dominate in the mining market for the coin, however, it is always not quite clear why totally legit activity is banned and why developers (along with some users) can do hard-fork for this particular reason.## Decentralization of VerificationDecentralization of verification is about possibility to check validity of blockchain history. Such check provides confidence that nothing bad (i.e not conforming to a protocol) was injected to the blockchain and thus give a user a right to reject malicious chain even if it has absorbed more work than alternatives. There were many talks about such the right in the Bitcoin community when it was partly hot about User-Activated Soft Fork (UASF) idea, and recent article [ï¿½Who secures Bitcoin?""](https://medium.com/@BitcoinErrorLog/who-secures-bitcoin-95b19bbcda3c) is summarizing this way of thinking well.If verification can be done in reasonable time only by an entity able to spend millions on renting a datacenter, obviously a network is not decentralized. Ideally, it should be possible to check integrity of the whole blockchain on commodity hardware, like a decent laptop.However, new blockchains also tend to absorb more and more features, and they are not coming for free. Then the huge topic in the research community is about how to make possible to check integrity of the whole blockchain with pruned blocks or system state (or both) under plausible assumptions. Possible solutions here are about bootstrapping state snapshot and blockchain suffix on top of it (popular in Ethereum protocol clients, and formalized in [an academic paper even](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/129.pdf)), stateless clients ([partially stateless](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/994), as implemented in [Ergo Platform](https://ergoplatform.org/en/) or [fully stateless](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/968) which do exist only in research papers currently).",Neutral sentiment,1159

(iâ€™m decent but also a degenerate gambler). i ran it up to 250% of its value within an hour; and then proceeded to lose it all back the next hour. i get stupid levels of greedy. \n\nafter all this, i was sure i didnâ€™t have any crypto left. fast forward to this year, i regained interest a couple months ago. i started up the trading bot again with much more conservative settings. iâ€™ve been buying a little here and there to hold.\n\ntoday i had the idea to check on some wallets i hadnâ€™t touched in over 3 years. i found my private keys written down deep within the recesses of my filing cabinet. i fired up the olâ€™ metamask and what did i findâ€¦ a balance of nexo tokens i had completely forgotten about. they had gained around 800%, and briefly were up 2000% back in may. \n\nmy lizard brain immediately thought of transferring them and either selling or trying to do something else with them, but i paused and will just leave them be. hopefully i forget about them for another few years.\n\ntl;dr- employed a bunch of tactics to try and profit, failed miserablyâ€¦ first profits came from buying crypto and forgetting about it",Negative,470

"yield farming ftw? a critical view on risks in defi the new focus on defi governance yield farming and recent memory of black thursday amplifies concerns about the poorly understood structure of risks in defi. we (researchers at cornell and imperial college london) have been working on a risk-based model to help better understand the involved risks.\n\nas such, we provide a new foundation for characterizing and modeling these risks; this is developed in the context of stablecoins but is more widely applicable to many crypto-economic systems, including cross-chain protocols (think ren, tbtc, wbtc), collateralized lending (think compound, aave, dydx), and decentralized exchanges (think uniswap, curve, balancer). our framework focuses on measures of incentive security, meaning that participation is mutually profitable for all parties after accounting for attack surfaces, and economic stability, which poses the question of whether incentives actually lead to stable outcomes.\n\nwe identify an important sustainability concern: in some defi systems designed with broad governance powers and without societal recourse, the equilibrium participation of rational agents may be zero. this is because the cost to align incentives in these systems may be prohibitively high (an analogy is requiring a bank to have a long-term p/e ratio of 1000 to be secure against the theft of depositor funds). our framework provides a means to model these systems and yields an array of unanswered research questions that will be critical for defi going forward.\n\ntwitter thread: [ post: [ paper: [",Question,312

Now the problem is bitcoin is actually too secure, unnecessarily secure, because it uses a lot of energy to maintain that difficulty, and so you shouldnï¿½t participate in it because anything that uses ï¿½too muchï¿½ energy is just bad.   Honestly feels like since no one can  control bitcoin, unlike every other asset in existence, that means for whatever reason even antithetical sets of reasons, we should all just stay in our sandbox and quit looking beyond.",Noise,181

"although the concept of liquidity mining has been around for a while, it has been tepid before. however, just after the decentralized finance (defi) protocol compound launched a new mechanism and distributed its network governance token comp to users, liquidity mining suddenly became popular. different priorities\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nin proof-of-work mining, paying miners to prove blocks may be more important than fair distribution of tokens to market participants in defi. without proofs, there would be no distributed consensus, let alone a functioning blockchain. a side effect of token distribution is that you can pre-mine empirically (some tokens on the ethereum blockchain do) and still produce a functioning blockchain.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nhowever, this priority is reversed in the compound protocol. technically, compound does not need to pay liquidity providers at all to function properly, so this also alleviates some people is concerns that liquidity mining may be a ""ponzi scheme"". comp tokens have a positive value because liquidity mining participants who hold comp tokens can earn fees from the protocol in the future. we can compare the distribution of comp tokens to users with the past operations in the defi industry. in the past, if those early investors participated in pre-mining, they could also sell the tokens they obtained in the market later.\n\n compound decided to distribute comp tokens to a wider range of token holders for several reasons:\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\ntoken distribution itself can attract new users (this is the same as cpu/gpu mining in the cryptocurrency industry in attracting new users);\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\ncomp tokens can vote on various changes to the compound protocol, and because the token owners are so large, the community is less likely to bypass byzantine fault tolerance or implement short-term changes that used to be highly centered occur on the entity of the transformation;\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nit is easier to convince regulators that comp tokens are not securities when users make money by working with each other rather than paying token users back to early investors.\n\ndifferent implementations\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nthe first thing to note here is that both bitcoin and compound have a certain degree of control over their actions when executing rewards. through this ""control"", both bitcoin and compound can create specific incentives for miners.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nin bitcoin, the incentive is for miners to include and validate as many transactions as possible, while also requiring miners to keep mining at the top of the blockchain. in general, the mechanisms of positive workload, block producers, timestamps, and incentives make bitcoin a trustless electronic cash system. bitcoin requires miners to follow this specific strategy to secure the network, also known as nakamoto consensus.\n\nhowever, scholars such as eyal published a paper in 2013 that nakamoto consensus may not be perfect. he proposed a strategy called ""selfish mining"" (selfish mining), which can allow a few mining pools to obtain more money than they honestly perform mining. mining protocol for more benefits. under this strategy, ""selfish mining"" will potentially destabilize bitcoin and promote mining centralization. although there is no clear evidence of selfish mining in the market, the risk is always there.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nin contrast, compoundâ€™s optimal incentive strategy for liquidity miners has changed a lot and made many improvements. compound is able to do this because their liquidity miners have a lot of incentive strategies to choose from - after all users need to pay a certain amount of comp tokens for (almost) any action they want to take in the compound protocol.\n\nin fact, the compound protocol is designed this way because the priority of the compound protocol is not to incentivize specific behaviors on the network (such as bitcoin miners mining is a specific behavior, and they also earn btc for mining token rewards), compound is purpose is to provide tokens to a large number of users. here, letâ€™s look at a counter-example: synthetix, the defi protocol that uses its token snx in a more targeted way. in order to defend the peg of the synthetic stablecoin snx, the synthetix protocol will provide incentives for those who add liquidity to the dai/usdc/usdt/susd pool on curve (i.e. ""liquidity providers"").\n\nhowever, for a period of time, bat, the currency with the best comp liquidity mining revenue, almost monopolized comp mining. generally speaking, the higher the deposit rate, the more efficient comp mining will be, but miners will basically stick to the incentives as their share of the comp token reward is based on the interest paid. unilaterally increasing the scale of bat deposits cannot increase the interest rate, because the factor that directly affects the interest rate is the loan ratio. as a result, large bat users deposit other assets in their accounts, and continue to increase the scale of mortgage until all the previously deposited bat is lent. this kind of the model has also become ""interest paid while receiving interest"", which ultimately pushes up the capital utilization rate, and leads to the marginalization of mainstream assets that use ""real"" asset supply and lending, and thus cannot obtain due incentives.\n\nsummarize\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nfor the problems mentioned above, compound quickly patched up the issuance mechanism, but the question seems to still exist, namely: is there an optimal incentive strategy that can be replaced? indeed, compound does not have a ""nakamoto consensus"" nor a strategy that miners are explicitly required to follow, and they may hope that at least some rewards will not be captured by anomalous strategies. simple users who deposit usdc and usdt in compound are like the easiest and most stable flow of funds in the existing banking system, anyway, a cryptocurrency system like compound can ""attract"" billions of bank deposits coming in was definitely a huge success.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nof course, whether it is liquidity mining or positive workload, these mechanisms ultimately need to be weighed. rather than implementing a very specific incentive strategy and then building a distributed protocol around that strategy, we may need to prioritize the protocol from the mining side - this way, many actions on the network can be rewarded and ""stimulated"" more. multiple possible incentive strategies emerge.",Neutral sentiment,1311

"A quick guide to crypto fundamental analysisThe concept of fundamental analysis entails finding the intrinsic value of a particular crypto by looking at various factors associated with it. It involves digging through its history, understanding its purpose, and what makes it valuable, among others. \n\nNot only does this research help determine if the crypto is worth investing in, but you can also use it to check if it is a suitable long-term investment option for you.\n\nThe number of cryptos keeps increasing every day. So, it is vital to understand that they are projects usually undertaken by a single person or a group of people. All cryptos do not have the backing of a reputed company or the stability that you might need. \n\nTo investigate this and find if crypto is undervalued or overvalued at the moment, investors rely on fundamental analysis. In fact, you will notice several veteran crypto investors use fundamental analysis to understand crypto. \n\nThe fundamental analysis of crypto consists of some basic research. For starters, you can analyse the team behind the crypto offering. Usually, every crypto developer has a GitHub profile, where they post updates regarding the project. You can also check the purpose of the project, and if it answers any existing problems in the market.\n\nYou can also use factors like the number of wallets created, the number of transactions made, and the volume and frequency of these transactions to gauge an estimation of the crypto?s value. While performing fundamental analysis, you should remember that crypto analysis is vastly different from analysing any other finances. For starters, it requires a lot of research since it is a relatively new space in the market. \n\nSecondly, there are a lot of variables involved.

"Senator Cynthia Lummis announced that they will unveil a proposal to fully integrate digital assets into the financial system next week. Will this be a good or bad thing for crypto? Some hours age senator Cynthia Lummis announced that they will unveil a proposal to fully integrate digital assets into the financial system next week on Twitter.\n\nThe full tweet:\n\n\&gt; ""Weâ€™ve been teasing it for months, but the time is almost here â€“ a proposal to fully integrate digital assets into our financial system. Excited to finally unveil this effort next week. Stay tuned!""\n\nThe question now is how this will be good/bad for crypto. \n\nDue to the latest events with Luna I think that some regulation will be needed to prevent this kind of scandals. It gives crypto a bad name due to some individuals! Also regulation will lead to a more global adoption for crypto.\n\nThe downside is that crypto will be more controlled, so more centralized. I also fear that with the proposal some extra tax issues will occur, because most of the time some people want to win something from proposals!\n\nWhat do you think about this?

"Shitcoin Sunday- Saitama, Lilly Finance, and DD vs FUD Shitcoin Sunday- Saitama, Lilly Finance, and DD vs FUD\n\nThis my first post here and I hope that I am bringing something good to the table. I have enjoyed lurking here for years but am usually too busy to get involved on Reddit. Luckily, I have some extra time on my hands, a few extra bucks to spare, and wanted to bring some awareness of concerns with a token growing in popularity. \n\nI like to dabble in shitcoins, where else can you potentially 100x or 1000x your pocket change in a very short time. But this space of the cryptosphere is rife with bullshit and DD is paramount to make sure you don't get rugged. Keep in mind, DD is NOT FUD. It is research into the history of and team behind any investment you are considering. Not doing DD leads to FUD as unsubstantiated rumors swirl. Established facts are not FUD and they should be considered as part of DD.\n\nEnter Saitama token. Saitama token was minted as Saitam Inu on May 30, 2021. You can have a poke around the creator wallet here if you want to go down the rabbit hole that I have but this post is not about some of the red flags there.\n\nHere is the creator wallet:\n\n0x980817e617ca5cDf220e87f5544592BF7a9661b3\n\nBack in June when I first came across this token it felt like a money grab. The webpage at that time was full of stock photos of young people and claimed that their goal was education. The Saitama team claimed that they are going to teach young and Gen Z people ""how money works while they invest"" and ""financial literacy"". How were they going to do this? By selling them a shitcoin.\n\nFast forward a few months and they have dropped the Inu from their name, they have amassed over 200,000 holders with no major listings, and the token has skyrocketed. Millionaires were made. No educational products were. \n\nLast night the devs at Saitama LLC threw a launch party for their new wallet in Vegas and rented a billboard in time square. No wallet is released, not even a beta for public testing, and some drunken youtuber supported by the devs makes a disappointing launch party into a shit show by begging money for drinks for most of his livestream. Public sentiment drops, as does the token price. Just another day in the shitcoin universe. \n\nThe other announcement they were celebrating was a new partnership with a medical company. This company, Lilly Finance, claims that they are going to revolutionize medical payments. Go to the Dr and pay with crypto. Their inspiration for this is the CEOâ€™s sick daughter. The COO of Saitama LLC is announced as a co-founder of Lilly Finance and you will only be able to buy the Lilly token through Saitamask, the upcoming Saitama wallet. \n\nSo who is Lilly Finance? It is a subsidiary of a company called Lillian Bay Medical LLC. Lillian Bay was registered 2 years ago and works in medical wholesale. The CEO of Lillyan Bay has been accused of being a part of a multimillion dollar fraud related to n95 mask distribution and is a defendant in a Racketeer, Influenced, and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) case.\n\nHer is the Lilly Finance website:\n\n[https://lillyfinance.com](https://lillyfinance.com/)\n\nYou can see their corporate registration here:\n\n[https://opengovus.com/sam-entity/117736642](https://opengovus.com/sam-entity/117736642)\n\nYou can read about the fraud accusation here:\n\n[https://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/news/2020/12/30/ceo-of-lillian-bay-medical-accused-of-defrauding.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/news/2020/12/30/ceo-of-lillian-bay-medical-accused-of-defrauding.html)\n\nYou can follow the court filings related the the RICO case here:\n\n[https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/37687996/TriPharma,\_Inc\_v\_Safe\_Harvest\_Medical,\_LLC](https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/37687996/TriPharma,_Inc_v_Safe_Harvest_Medical,_LLC)\n\nSo what is Saitamaâ€™s relationship to Lilly Finance and why are they forging an exclusive partnership with them for their wallet launch? I looked up the contract address on the Lilly Finance website and had a poke around. This was difficult to do as the address is an image and not text so I had to manually type it.\n\nHere is the contact address if you want to have a look yourself:\n\n0xD0222AF85B9B08D38233F4bc940646bf18445949\n\nThere I found the address of the wallet that created and currently holds all of the Lilly supply. You can find it here:\n\n0x3Af0eD4573E7e1c11CDffE9Af970bff7DCFAffd3\n\nOf note is that the first and last transactions from the wallet that created Lillly are a round trip of ETH in and out from a top Saitama whale who has been in Saitama since day one. Remember, the COO of Saitama LLC is on the board of Lilly Finance and is listed as a co-founder. Here is that wallet address:\n\n0xF9A98037b5cCd0185161D762278FC009C8056c4e\n\nMore worrisome is that said wallet has been dumping huge amounts of Saitama the last several weeks. That person has become very wealthy and their dumps are likely affecting the price of Saitama.\n\nSo, we have a professional connection between Lilly and Saitama by way of a common board member and we have financial evidence of connection between an early Saitama investor and the creation of Lillyâ€™s token.\n\nWhat does all this mean? That is up to the individual investor to decide. DD is about gathering all of the facts and assessing them against your risk tolerance. Given the sentiment on the Saitama boards greed is strong and these facts donâ€™t seem to matter to many investors.\n\nMy broader concerns are with the ethics of both companies. If you are going to bill yourself as financial education this is not the way I would do it. By putting money into either of these projects I am funding the devs. Are these the types of people I want to support?",Noise,1452

"ï¿½Itï¿½s attractive to buy.ï¿½ Why will bitcoin still rise in price? Bitcoin fell to a three-month low of $42,100. Analysts told when the bull market will end and why the price of the asset may return to growth in the coming days.  \n\n\n[Photo by Austin Distel](https://preview.redd.it/sfb0r1aqn2071.jpg?width=1350&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=596babe15b797a59c323636884603fe8f451a7a1)\n\n**What happened?**\n\nOn the evening of May 16, billionaire Elon Musk criticized bitcoin. He also responded with the word ï¿½reallyï¿½ to the suggestion that Tesla will announce the sale of all its bitcoins in the next quarter.\n\n**Bitcoin falling**\n\nAmid Muskï¿½s words, the bitcoin rate fell to a three-month low of about $42,000 in the morning of May 17. Afterwards, the billionaire wrote that Tesla did not start selling off its accumulated bitcoins, contrary to rumors.\n\n**Why does the bull market continue?**\n\nThere is no reason to start a downward trend or end the bull market, analysts believe. Moreover, Elon Musk is far from being the only major player in the cryptocurrency industry. Funds and institutional investors wonï¿½t sell their assets without a reason.\n\n**Is cryptocurrency worth buying?**\n\nThe price of bitcoin is ï¿½more attractive than ever to buy,ï¿½ according to analysts. According to him, the growth of cryptocurrency quotes is not over yet. The expert suggested that the beginning of the long-term decline of the asset will be discussed after the rate reaches $100,000.\n\n**When will a new wave of growth begin?**\n\nA surge of interest in buying and growth in trading volume may begin in the coming days. The current bitcoin price is ï¿½quite attractive. Already in June the first cryptocurrency may update its historical maximum of $64.8 thousand.\n\n**Support from the big players**\n\nLast week, BlackRock investment director Rick Reeder called bitcoin an interesting asset that has yet to reach maturity.

"What is the difference between swap and exchange crypto? The mechanics of swapping and trading crypto on exchanges are the same, but the difference in outcome is significant.\n\n**SWAP**\n\nSwap is a crypto-to-crypto exchange. It conveniently converts your crypto assets for their equivalent value in another coin or token to either build a portfolio, cut losses, use crypto as payment, or avoid slippage costs or other high transaction fees.\n\nFor example, if the other user wants to send you $100 in Ethereum (ETH), but you prefer to receive Bitcoin (BTC) to build your portfolio, you can enable the Easy Swap Engine so the app would automatically swap any ETH or any other currency you receive into BTC.\n\nSwapping from your Private Key Wallets benefits non-custodial, on-chain trade settlement. Swapping from your Trading Accounts provides faster settlement and no network fees.\n\n**EXCHANGE**\n\nExchanging crypto, on the other hand, deals with digital trading assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and even tangible assets. It involves buying or selling crypto. You trade one crypto for another crypto or a fiat currency based on their current market price to increase your earnings, whether short- or long-term. Trading pairs are involved in the exchange process, like the BTC/USDT or KASTA/USDT.\n\n**To Sum Up**\n\nNow that we understand how swapping and exchange work, our decision-making becomes more polished. Remember that there are no fixed strategies when it comes to crypto trading. The market is constantly fickle, so the best approach is to keep an open mind and an open eye to opportunities.",Question,350

"amidst the backlash around kickstarter â€“ why do you think people hate blockchain technology? for those not caught up, kickstarter [announced last year]( that it was moving its business onto the blockchain, notably onto (carbon negative) celo. the outcry was swift and fierce. and in the past few days â€“ in the midst of kickstarter creators and backers pledging to leave the service â€“ they've pumped the brakes on the project, choosing not to release their white paper, and pushing the project back into the 'research and analysis' phase. \n\ni'm curious what people think here â€“ the obvious rallying cry from critics is that 'crypto is killing the planet!' â€“ which is a classic case of the general notion that, **nothing or no one is a monolith** (yes, bitcoin uses tons of energy, and yes, we have a solve for that in pos). though critics, who we can infer consist at least substantially of woke progressives, and who should innately understand this principle, reek of ignorance. \n\nbut there is something deeper. these are the same people that laugh at nft is and think the whole system consists of miscreants and dupes. sure, that exists, but there is so much freakin amazing stuff happening in this space â€“Â and ironically a lot of what is taking place is completely aligned with the progressive agenda. \n\none huge misstep imo that kickstarter didn't do, which they should have, was with this announcement, also announce a dao. if done with the proper education, backers and project owners would see that with this change they'd have greater control over the service, that they could actually be able to now make decisions to shape the future of what kickstarter will be, all thanks to blockchain technology. this is a perfect use-case, which puts the power in the hands of the community (something web2 has never done) â€“Â how is that not progress? how does that not appeal to the progressive agenda? \n\nwith that said â€“ the thing i'm wondering is whether ultimately that is what it is, that the critics think that it in some capacity the blockchain is this shrouded entity that removes their power, their agency, their voice â€“â€“ when the reality couldn't be further from the truth. sure, anonymity is a thing atm, and that may help breed the misconception, but c'mon, how do they not see that when everything is on a public ledger, the people now have way more power, more transparency and can hold accountable the powers that be. \n\nso curious to hear people is thoughts?",Negative,547

It?s a peer-to-peer system that enables anyone to send and receive payments anywhere. Instead of being physical money carried around and exchanged in the real world, cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries to an online database describing specific transactions. The transactions are recorded in a public ledger when you transfer cryptocurrency funds. Cryptocurrency is stored in digital wallets.\n\nCryptocurrency received its name because it uses encryption to verify transactions. This means advanced coding is involved in storing and transmitting cryptocurrency data between wallets and public ledgers.

"timing the market newbie confession i would like to share my experience with everyone here, considering the recent dump/consolidation/correction.\n\nas many new people here, january/february with gme/dogecoin was everywhere, it intrigued me also. i bought a few hundred $ of doge and parallelly start to explore other altcoins. as i was reading more and more, mainly in r/cc sub, i realized doge is shit, and there other great projects with real business/development value. i sold my doge, and bought some xrp, ada, vet, one. as i was continued to explore, i was buying more coins. later on, bought some lto as it looked really promising, and eth also. i didn't buy any btc, the return will be small i was thinking, and the best is to earn on alts and then transfer earnings into btc. i made some really quick gains and started to sell my coins as i was thinking to buy them again when they drop. i managed some of them to buy at the lower price, but some of them i bought at the higher price later, as the fomo kicked in. little by little, i was trying to time the market. waiting for a dip, it sometimes comes, other times it doesn't. last week, while going through my transactions, i saw that i bought one for 0.07, vet at 0.04, lto 0.3, eth 1200. if i only held it until today, without ever checking charts, my return will be around 8 times larger than are now. 8 fcking times.\n\nthe amount of time i invested in learning technical analysis, is well spent, as i really love to learn new things and it will be quite useful for future investment. but i was talking about the amount of time i spent trying to predict dip or correction, i could smarter invest in mining more fiat and only buying more coins and hold them. my point here is, don't try to time the market, sometimes you will win, sometimes you will lose (if you are not really experienced/knowledgeable, you will lose more). learn from my mistakes, my example, because in my case, by being in the market for only three months, and simply holding what i bought at the begging could give me 8x more return right now. now imagine what can you accomplish with more time in the market, because we are still early in this, trust me with that, people from the small town i live still don't know what crypto is, i dare to say 5% heard of it, but less than 1% invested in it. \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\ntldr:\n\ndon't try to time the market, buy any amount you can and hold. if i only held, for three short months i am in market, i would easily 8x the money i made trying to buy the dip, sell - time the market.",Negative,626

"an open discussion on eip-1559 im curious what people think about eip-1559. you can find a good explanation of the proposal [here.]( along with eth 2.0 and drastic reduction of block rewards is why im so bullish on eth. \n\neip-1559 is very controversial however. heres a tl;dr on ethereum improvement proposal (eip) 1559\n\n- the current auction-based fee system that a lot of other popular coins use will potentially be done away with. \n\n- users will pay a static fee with the option of a tip. the fee will be burned (removes eth from circulation) and the tips will go to the miners. \n\n- the goal is to fill half the block with standard transactions and the other half with tipped transactions. \n\n- the base fee will increase and decrease. if all available transactions will fill 50% or the block the base fee rises. if they fill less than 50% of the block the fee falls. \n\n- the tip is a way to ensure youre in the next block. this bit is the controversial part to me. its removing an auction system but keeping an auction system for 50% of a block. \n\n- flexible block sizes are on the table. \n\n- this promises to drastically reduce the fees for eth transactions and start to deflate eth by burning the base fees. this is good for upward price movement. \n\n\ni am a miner (albeit not as big as i was when i had 36 1070s mining in 2017) and im all for this eip. bigger miners arent as big a fan. they see fees being burned and issuance being cut and theyre nervous. \n\ni feel like this will be moot when eth 2.0 merges with eth. eth 2.0 is live right now and is dubbed the beacon chain. soon (hopefully end of 2021) eth as it stands today will be added to eth 2.0\nas a shard of the beacon chain. more elaborate sharding capabilities will go live in 2022. \n\n\noverall i think eip-1559 is a nice addition to the move to staking vs mining. reducing supply of eth will promote upward price movement and take a ton of stress off the eth network, where fees are incredibly high right now. \n\nwhat do you all think? im curious about the communitys thoughts about not only 1559 but how the network will respond to the end of gpu mining of eth. \n\nat minimum us gamers are finally going to be able to buy gpus to game without having to sell a kidney to afford one :) \n\neths future is bright! \n\nfull disclosure - right now about 70% of my portfolio is in eth and eth 2.0 staking. ive been in crypto since late 2011. \n\ncheers all!",Miscellaneous,620

"Scammed yesterday, need help getting support from Cybercrime Division.hello people, just before Ethereum Merge, there were many scams running and I fell for one. I am a dickhead and thought that I was immune to such bullshit. In my case the guy was impersonating Vitalik - founder of Ethereum. He posted a fake giveaway on Twitter id u/Zidwait saying that he will give 2x Ethereum back to people who deposit ETH in his wallet. This was also the top result in Google Search as well for the whole day. \n\nHe had linked a site - [www.ethereum-celebration.com](https://www.ethereum-celebration.com) where he had shared his wallet address - **0x346b289363a057387d0d6b8b568abfbc82a8b0a6** where ETH had to be deposited. I deposited around 0.428 ETH and obviously didn't get anything back as I had fallen for a scam foolishly. \n\nI instantly reported this to Binance customer support, and they told me that they could only help me if the scammer had his wallet with Binance only, otherwise they couldn't do anything and told me to report to local law enforcement. I have already made a detailed report on [cybercrime.gov.in](https://cybercrime.gov.in) website portal with screenshots and all but I haven't got any response. I even tried to call their helpline number today, but no one picked the call. \n\nNow I did my own research the whole day and was able to track the scammer's transactions to a Binance wallet which I reported to Binance few hours back. They have told me that they have frozen his account, but **they cannot block it permanently and they need a request from a law enforcement to block his account** and get my money back. I provided them with below proof - \n\nthis is the wallet (#1) address they were using to get eth deposited - [https://etherscan.io/address/0x346b289363a057387d0d6b8b568abfbc82a8b0a6](https://etherscan.io/address/0x346b289363a057387d0d6b8b568abfbc82a8b0a6) . Check the 2nd and 3rd transactions to their new Wallet (#2) - **0xd1b7cca582578bff37faab547a4d50ff6342c6d0**. He obviously reroutes the stolen ETH across various wallets. Now see this transaction from wallet #2 to another new wallet (#3) - **0xFAA9C6676473D049FAe82D8277d1f53028FF76Ae**. Then, as can be seen @ [https://etherscan.io/address/0xfaa9c6676473d049fae82d8277d1f53028ff76ae](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfaa9c6676473d049fae82d8277d1f53028ff76ae) , he transfers all the stolen ETH from wallet #3 into his Binance wallet. As you can see this wallet is only used to transfer funds into Binance. There are no other outgoing transactions. \n\nFor anyone still not convinced, follow a few transactions at this link -  [Address 0xab6db7eb524e2d06c5209e21e68ba02dc501f912 | Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xab6db7eb524e2d06c5209e21e68ba02dc501f912) \n\nI have some other proofs for his other wallets as well, but this was the easiest to explain. From his other wallets that I saw, this person seems to have scammed to tune of almost hundreds of thousands of dollars. This is what Binance is seeking -  \n\n'*An official Law Enforcement request raised by a police officer through the following link* [*https://www.binance.com/en/support/law-enforcement*](https://www.binance.com/en/support/law-enforcement) *from an official email address and attaching the following:*\n\n*A. The photo, name, mailbox, and telephone contact of the investigating officer. B. It is necessary to issue an official document of assistance with an official seal, C. The letter should specify what information Binance needs to provide to cooperate with the investigation (such as providing account information corresponding to the 0xfaa9c6676473d049fae82d8277d1f53028ff76ae address and other involved addresses, real name information, phone number, etc.)'*\n\nNow, the issue is that I didn't get any support from Cybercrime portal. After researching the shit out of everything and talking with Binance support till late evening, I went to local cybercrime cell (*which I was not even sure if it existed in first place. I live in a Tier 3 city*) and they told me to go to State Cyber cell tomorrow morning. But from their google reviews I am pretty sure I won't get much help there either. I have also reported this on Interpol's website as Binance support executive recommended. Now what should I do? Where do I get any support?",Question,1135

"3 Undervalued DeFi Tokens To Maximize Your Gains In 2022.$AVAX surged by over 3,100%, $LINK surged by over 600%, and $THETA surged by over 500% during the 2021 bull run. These are some of the top-performing tokens that helped investors make a fortune.\n\nNow, the current market scenario may make you believe that DeFi is past the hype that led to a massive rally. But, DeFi?s growth rides on increasing adoption. The DeFi market cap was around $150 billion by the end of 2021. Once the market recovers from a prolonged bear phase, DeFi?s market cap can surely breach the previous all-time high.\n\nDecentralized Finance aims to transform traditional finance through digitization and decentralization. The vision of DeFi and crypto coincide. With all the major economies embracing digitization through steps like CBDC, DeFi is here to stay. Thus, it is one sector that you must target for the long term.\n\n**Best DeFi Tokens To Invest In 2022**\n\n1. **$ZBC:** With wallet hacks and breaches becoming a major headache for investors, who wouldn?t want a more secure DeFi industry? No one, right? Zebec protocol emerges from this requirement to enhance the security of your digital assets through a multi-sig treasury. Zebec protocol is a continuous settlement protocol that allows users to get paid by seconds. Built on Solana, Zebec is poised to rise big in the coming months. $ZBC is currently trading at $0.011 and could be a great pick if you seek to diversify your investment.\n2. **$MANA:** $MANA is the native token of, Decentraland, an extremely popular metaverse project built on Ethereum. With companies like Facebook rebranding themselves to jump on the metaverse bandwagon, $MANA is primed to go big in the coming months. With the current market price of $MANA being $0.74, it could be one of the best-performing metaverse tokens in 2022. Since the project allows users to buy virtual land and build digital real estate, it is going to hold the attention of creators in the times to come.\n3. **$ATOM:** $ATOM is the native token of Cosmos, another extremely popular DeFi project that powers an ecosystem of blockchains. The widespread use cases of the project add to its solid fundamentals. The current market price of $ATOM is $14.23. Cosmos aims to create an internet of blockchains. With the mission so big, the interests of the project coincide with the principles of both DeFi and Web3. Thus, $ATOM is certainly a good investment in the long term.",Miscellaneous,578

But every month I transfer 50k to my mother, so technically I dont save anything personally. \n\nBut the money which I used for trading was mostly of my motherâ€™s savings without knowing her. She only knows that I have invested 2 lakhs in crypto. For rest 8 lakhs, I have used my motherâ€™s savings money (almost 5.5 lakhs) as well as my initial bonus (2.5 lakhs) from job, which my mom is unaware of. \n\nRight now I have 2 lakhs invested in Crypto Market, I an not going to liquidate that and hoping that one day it will give me good returns.\n\nBut, I face a lot of personal issues because of all these losses.

"A Oasis protocol (ROSE) shill post. Felt like a proper shill post is warranted these days as most posts right now are just low effort articles or posts about DCA. \n\n\n**Fundamentals:**\n\n-What is ROSE/Oasis Protocol? It is an L1 which can serve as an L2 and can allow ANY L1 to process secure, private off chain computation or give privacy qualities to literally any other crypto. The main implications of these are:\n\nPeople can control and monetize their data, companies can monetize data of their customers further without violating privacy laws, DeFi can offer new products such as under collateralized lending.\n\nParcel allows users and/or companies to store data on chain and sell or just make that data available without any of the personal information attached to said data. As example you can think of having medical records on chain. These records could help medical research and this can then be done without giving out your personal data (name and such). A partnership with Genetica has been formed to make this happen. \n\nA good article is here: https://docs.oasis.dev/oasis-network-primer/\n\n**tl;dr**: Rose unlocks an entirely new set of use cases &amp; products for crypto and allows corporations to play roles they otherwise would not be able to.\n\n-Dawn Song, the founder and CEO of Oasis Labs &amp; the Oasis Protocol, is the world is most reputable computer security scientist. A lot of her work is used as foundational components for some of the biggest crypto projects today. She is also a co-founder of a reputable cyber security company called Menlo Security which has thousands of REAL (not crypto vaporcompanies) customers including many F500 is, and its last valuation was $800MM and it is very likely valued at over $1B today.\n\n**Product Roadmap:**\n\nOasis Labs' largest current product is called Parcel which is the core product for the ""letting companies monetize data in new ways"" concept. It is currently in use by several F500 companies and also a handful of other REAL non-crypto companies. However, Parcel is NOT yet on mainnet\n\nOnce Parcel is on mainnet, Oasis will officially have the most real world (non-crypto) usage outside of anything other than maybe ETH. In short: It is not just some DeFi shitcoin PnD chain like pretty much everything else is. It is coming to the table right away with more useful adoption than ANYTHING else has.\n\nThey're also soon to release both a Cipher and ETH paratime and bridges which will immediately alllow anyone to port over dapps, tokens, etc. to the network and make it usable for the majority of the crypto space, meaning all the DeFi use cases and even new use cases will be available for existing crypto entities.\n\n**Pumpamentals:**\n\n-ROSE had one of the highest VC raises of all time in crypto ($45MM in 2018) and has operated totally under the radar, finally launching the network in late 2020. -The VCs are legit crypto VC funds like a16z, Fred Eshram, Polychain, Binance, and others. Salesforce is listed on the Oasis Labs website but I can't find them listed on the Salesforce Ventures site so it is hard to know for sure about this one.\n \n-Recent history shows us with similar projects from a VC perspective, they ultimately pump like fucking crazy. Solana is a great example, and a lot of the same capital is invested in ROSE. These are players used to seeing minimally 50-100x on their investments and right now the earliest ones only have about a 5x. There is no fucking chance given the fundamentals they are going to sell ROSE for anything less than a 100x, mark my words ($3) and I am willing to bet many will hold large portions of their holdings way beyond that. -The public is starting to take notice. Whether it is discord shilling or whatever, I see more shitty crypto influencers starting to mention it, and it is only a matter of time before everyone does a full feature on ROSE and crypto twitter is talking about it. You are still early to the show that we're just watching start to unfold now. \n\n- Noteworthy to mention as well is Oasis is partnership with Meta something that should be highlighted by both Oasis and Meta very soon as said in the most recent Townhall meeting (1st of June). Seems to me at least that Meta will use Parcel to give users a way to monetize their data, but most importantly it gives Meta a more legal way to collect and sell/use data without violating privacy laws. \n\n**Fud:**\n\n-Token supply: 10B. Yea, it is a lot. We can easily just say ""crypto is a clown market, look at ADA ($3 at 45B max supply putting ROSE at a $13.50 price tag) or XRP or DOGE or whatever but I want to look beyond the clown market. The token release schedule is over TEN years. As I stated in pumpamentals it is very unlikely in the November unlock (which is one of the bigger ones) VCs just dump their bags. That would really surprise me. In 10 years, can a chain that enables entirely new important privacy oriented use cases have a market cap of a mere $10B? In TEN FUCKING YEARS? That is $1 ROSE. But realistically by then I think the mcap will be in the hundreds of billions of dollars, partly due to inflation but largely due to crypto adoption being in near full force by then. I see no reason ROSE can't hit $5-10 within the next couple of years and I actually think it could be a $20+ coin one day. -""It is just another L1/ETH killer"". No, it is an L1 but it is a VERY critical L2 and the L1 properties which are important right now have no competitors. It is an ETH enabler. In fact, much like LINK, it will enable everything in crypto to be more valuable than it already is.\n\n-Here is fud that I think is somewhat REAL but never actually gets discussed: There are no concrete plans for token holders to monetize their tokens after the staking gains wash up. Validators are not required to pay out on transaction fee profits, and none of them currently do. The theory is, the network will grow to a point where there will be plenty of alternative ways to monetize your ROSE via dapps (whether that is in DeFi or via a type of company/product that doesn't even exist yet), and empowering the ecosystem in other ways, that by the time staking gains dry up you'll still have reasons to hold. I'd look at this as a tl;dr of ""network succeeds - you win, network loses - token is worthless to you"", but if the network doesn't succeed the token will be worthless anyway. Additionally, I could see a world where validators are trying to accumulate bigger stacks to process more jobs and get a larger % of the network fees and so DO start paying a share of transaction fees to anyone staking with them. I think that is how it will play out. But ultimately, you also will always have the option to run your own validator and the crypto space is making this easier and easier for people.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nI didn't write most of this myself just changed a few things to make it up-to-date. This write up was made by an anonymous user on 4chan. I also am heavily invested in ROSE myself so take that into consideration as well. \n\nWould also not advice investing in ROSE at this time due to the current market situation, would just suggest on keeping an eye on ROSE for when the market turns more bullish again.",Objective,1646

"Bitcoin Mixing: Transfer Public Coins PrivatelyHey guys, Hope y'all are doing well. Today I would like to talk about Crypto Mixers (famously known as Bitcoin Mixer).\n\nIf you've read my previous posts, you know that I really frown upon usage of Private coins due to the regulation barrier they face. So, today I will share a way you can use to transfer Public coins (Bitcoin, Etheruem, Ripple, etc)\n\nIf we are going by the textbook definition, Bitcoin mixers act as a middleman between 2 of your accounts and remove any digital signatures of your transfer. \n\nThink of it as a VPN but for blockchain. They mask your receiving address with a random temporary address, and send you using another random temporary address. so if anyone look up those temporary addresses in explorer, they will only see the receive/send transaction but won't find any connection between your wallets. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's understand with a definition. \n\nNormally: If I buy bitcoin in WazirX and send it to my Trust Wallet. You can look up the transaction with either trust wallet address or WazirX address. \n\nWith Mixer: I buy bitcoin in WazirX, send it to the Bitcoin mixer's address 1. Now Bitcoin mixer address 2 will send the transaction to my trust wallet, you can track the wazirx transaction till Bitcoin mixer address 1 and you can see that you received the amount in trust from bitcoin mixer 2 address. but there will be no connection between your wazirx wallet transaction and trust wallet transaction. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can google the name of the coin following the word ""mixer"" to find a good mixer, make sure, you always use Decentralized Mixer with good reviews.\n\nP.S. really sorry for poor formatting, posting from Phone in a hurry. if you have further question regarding this please comment under the post.",Neutral sentiment,419
