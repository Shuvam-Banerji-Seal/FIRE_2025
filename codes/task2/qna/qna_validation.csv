No not really, just don't overspend. Live within your means. \n\n2. Do some research about the tech and see if it's something you want to buy.

Here's something to get you started https://youtu.be/bBC-nXj3Ng4\n\n3. Any amount is ok to start, just *live within your means*. Overspending will give you anxiety.

My dad died when I was 18. I inherited just under $500,000. I was ""rich"" for a teenager. I tried to do things right. I bought a restaurant, was making very good money, I only worked 2 days a week and spent the rest of my time with my wife and kids(I got married at 21 and had a kid at 22.) Fast forward to the pandemic, my wife and I had separated about a year before covid. She had taken a lot of my money to support the kids. I ended up having to sleep at my restaurant for almost 1.5 years. Lost my business, became an alcoholic and was doing nothing in life. I invested every last penny I had in crypto and I've made like £25k in the past month. I'm back together with my wife and kids. I lived a very privileged life my whole life. I was born and raised in an affluent neighborhood in the US. I went to Pakistan for high school and had maids, cooks, drivers etc. I've always told people that my biggest fear in life wasn't death, it was poverty. I've always stressed about money after my dad died. I was always scared I'd blow through it all. After I lost everything, I was technically homeless, I realized that it is what it is. Now I don't give a shit about money. I have all my money in crypto and some days when the market is down, I say fuck it, I still don't sell. At one point I was down £14k and I didn't break a sweat. If I lose it all, it is what it is. You can always build yourself back up. My dad lost millions in 90's but he built himself back up as did a lot of my family members. Life doesn't end because you're broke. If anything, it might give you the motivation to get back up and make more money than you ever have. Worst case scenario, it'll be a good story to tell your kids. Hard times make hard men. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot I'd do differently if I could go back in time but I can't. Also, life is sooooo much more better with money lol but I just don't stress about it that much anymore.

"which is better: buying top coins vs. buying btc &amp; eth - (a 6 years dca case study) inspired by [this post]( i built a script to analyse if you dca'd blindly in the top crypto coins vs. investing in btc &amp; eth vs investing only in btc since the beginning of 2015, how much would your total worth is. here are the results.\n\n**numbers &amp; assumptions:**\n\n* dcaing takes place every week, on 1st, 8th, 15th and 22th of every month starting from jan 1st 2015 and until july 6th 2021.\n* investments budget per week is $100.\n* the weekly investment is divided equally on the coins invested in.\n* this case study is ignoring stable coin investments. e.g.: investing in the top 5 coins means the top 5 coins excluding any stable coins.\n* the analysis is assuming that you invested your money and never sold any coin till now.\n* total invested money over the whole dca period is $31,300.\n* transaction fees are not included in the analysis.\n\n**here are the results:**\n\n* if you blindly dca into the top 1 coins (btc), you will end up with **$1,102,104**.\n* if you blindly dca into the top 2 coins, you will end up with 4 coins (btc, xrp, ltc, eth) in your wallet and total worth of **$1,462,443**.\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 3 coins**, you will end up with 11 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,310,552.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 5 coins**, you will end up with 23 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,490,189.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 7 coins**, you will end up with 37 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,923,849.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 10 coins**, you will end up with 55 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,316,169.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 20 coins**, you will end up with 130 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,619,756.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 50 coins**, you will end up with 381 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$979,086.**\n* if you had a glass ball and knew that eth will be what it is today and you invested only in btc &amp; eth, you will end up with 2 coins in your wallet (surprise), and a total worth of **$4,505,477.**\n\n**some observations:**\n\n1. although it was relatively easier to guess that btc will be the #1 crypto coin back then, nobody would have guessed for sure that eth will be #2, so betting on btc &amp; eth only from the beginning would've been your strategy only if you know the future. (you are god). based on that it is safer to say ""i invest in the top x coins"" instead of saying i only invest in coin x and coin y.\n2. investing in altcoins in addition to btc can increase your roi considerably. investing in top 7-10 coins tends to yield the most return in this case study (x3).\n3. based on #2, a crypto etf (or a similar service from exchanges that allow us to buy in bulk) could give exposure to the top x coins while saving transaction costs considerably.\n\nif you want more details, here is what your wallet would look like in each case of the above:\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ note:** this whole case study was a fun project and i was trying to answer some questions and thought to share it with you in case that would help you in any way. also it is important to not that history does not dictate the future, so please take all of what i present here with a grain of salt.\n\nmuch love!

best exchange for trading? ive been using voyager mainly but i was wondering if there were other platforms people consider better. ive noticed with voyager it takes days for transactions to process resulting in me not being able to transfer my cryptos to somewhere like a wallet right away which kinda sucks. what other platforms do you guys use/recommend and if you can state why you like them thatd be great. thanks!,I'm not in the US but BinanceUS spot trading fees are 0.1% while instant buy/sell fees are 0.5%.

Or in other words, someone who owns 1 percent can validate 10 times as many transactions as you.\n\nIf a new block is generated, then a token is created as a reward, also like PoW.

"Scammed yesterday, need help getting support from Cybercrime Division.hello people, just before Ethereum Merge, there were many scams running and I fell for one. I am a dickhead and thought that I was immune to such bullshit. In my case the guy was impersonating Vitalik - founder of Ethereum. He posted a fake giveaway on Twitter id u/Zidwait saying that he will give 2x Ethereum back to people who deposit ETH in his wallet. This was also the top result in Google Search as well for the whole day. \n\nHe had linked a site - [www.ethereum-celebration.com](https://www.ethereum-celebration.com) where he had shared his wallet address - **0x346b289363a057387d0d6b8b568abfbc82a8b0a6** where ETH had to be deposited. I deposited around 0.428 ETH and obviously didn't get anything back as I had fallen for a scam foolishly. \n\nI instantly reported this to Binance customer support, and they told me that they could only help me if the scammer had his wallet with Binance only, otherwise they couldn't do anything and told me to report to local law enforcement. I have already made a detailed report on [cybercrime.gov.in](https://cybercrime.gov.in) website portal with screenshots and all but I haven't got any response. I even tried to call their helpline number today, but no one picked the call. \n\nNow I did my own research the whole day and was able to track the scammer's transactions to a Binance wallet which I reported to Binance few hours back. They have told me that they have frozen his account, but **they cannot block it permanently and they need a request from a law enforcement to block his account** and get my money back. I provided them with below proof - \n\nthis is the wallet (#1) address they were using to get eth deposited - [https://etherscan.io/address/0x346b289363a057387d0d6b8b568abfbc82a8b0a6](https://etherscan.io/address/0x346b289363a057387d0d6b8b568abfbc82a8b0a6) . Check the 2nd and 3rd transactions to their new Wallet (#2) - **0xd1b7cca582578bff37faab547a4d50ff6342c6d0**. He obviously reroutes the stolen ETH across various wallets. Now see this transaction from wallet #2 to another new wallet (#3) - **0xFAA9C6676473D049FAe82D8277d1f53028FF76Ae**. Then, as can be seen @ [https://etherscan.io/address/0xfaa9c6676473d049fae82d8277d1f53028ff76ae](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfaa9c6676473d049fae82d8277d1f53028ff76ae) , he transfers all the stolen ETH from wallet #3 into his Binance wallet.

There are no other outgoing transactions. \n\nFor anyone still not convinced, follow a few transactions at this link -  [Address 0xab6db7eb524e2d06c5209e21e68ba02dc501f912 | Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xab6db7eb524e2d06c5209e21e68ba02dc501f912) \n\nI have some other proofs for his other wallets as well, but this was the easiest to explain.

"Question about Bitcoin So I've been aware of Bitcoin for a long time now but I've always been a sceptic, this is probably going to be downvoted or called FUD. This would be a great time to ""buy the dip"" according to many but I can't find good arguments to my question so I figured I'd ask here. \n\nHow is this different from a ponzi scheme? People can only make money from people paying more in the future so any money I'd make is from someone buying hoping someone else would pay more, right? Not only that but money also dissapear from costs of mining and taxes. So for people to make 1 million other people have to spend more than that. How will this ever possibly change? According to information I can find a small amount of wallets contain a majority of all the Bitcoin so it doesn't sound like it's a wealth distributor either. \n\nYeah yeah, OP is just posting FUD and wouldn't want to buy Bitcoin anyways. Sure, if nobody can give me a good answer to this I won't.","I like that food for thought, I think it's an interesting discussion. And yeah, I've thought a lot about cryptos in general. I think it's an interesting human experiment if anything, even if it can be depressing at the same time. \n\nWhen it comes to comparing it to gold I'd say it's very different because people haven't adopted gold the same way as Bitcoin. Even if Bitcoin becomes ""real virtual gold"" the movement has been based around greed, hope and promises of wealth. I guess you can argue why it matters if it has a ""true"" value in the future but I'd consider it very manipulative when it comes to how it would reach that end game. But I also don't think I have a clear stance of fully formulated opinion on that.\n\nUntil then I wouldn't want to get into Bitcoin even if I think I could make money honestly. I know myself and I would feel bad if I made money, crashed and other people lost fortunes. Which maybe makes my stance very different from most people here, even more than how we see Bitcoins future.",0

"what will happen if ethereum cant reduce its fees everyone is happy about ethereum being on the rise but when it comes up to the fees, its a nightmare for every crypto trader to fear the huge fees except the whales imo. with the recent post from its founder vb who has pointed that there will be an update for ethereum to reduce its fees and with the zkrollup update everyone hopes for a lower fees. but what if ethereum cant deliver on this promise. will ethereum fall from its dominance, will there be a rival crypto which can replace ethereum with its infinite supply? if yes which other crypto will it be? and why it didnt happen till now. all of these questions are serious questions one must consider when it comes to investing in ethereum for long term. **ethereum can not be and will not be bitcoin** so stop hyping or giving it heat. because truth must be told and we all know what to do when it comes to investing your hard earned money. projects can easily change from blockchains to blockchains and if we all thing that crypto is in the beginning phase then a lot is yet to happen.","if they can't deliver, competition will win.",0

"is bitcoin is value solely based on the greater fool theory? disclaimer: i actually hold btc myself as an investment, but i'm really wondering what intrinsic value and use case bitcoin has.\njust to clarify, i do understand most of the technical details of bitcoin like mining, proof of work and the 21 million cap. \nthe greater fool theory is basically the idea that the price of an asset is determined by how much others are willing to pay for it. basically people buy something because they can sell it for more to a greater fool, who then hopes they can sell it to an even greater fool thus leading to the price continuing to grow as more and more people buy in. i'm sure we've all seen the likes of r/technology calling this ponzi/pyramid/mlm which isn't exactly what it is, but the idea is the same. \ni'm playing devil is advocate here, but what really sets btc apart from speculative bubbles like dutch tulips or beanie babies? as in why would you buy bitcoin other than hoping to sell it for more later? it was originally intended to be electronic cash but it obviously didn't go that route. \nif you say it is a store of value (which i understand why) it doesn't seem to hold stable value as of present, like precious metals do. will the price stabilise in the future or do we just hope it will?\nif you say the lack of barriers to easily transfer value anywhere in the world, there is plenty of much more efficient blockchain technologies that do it much better than btc.\nif you say decentralisation, that is not what the majority are buying btc for. they (including many of us) just want to make money. how much intrinsic value does it really provide?\njust to reiterate, i'm not against bitcoin. i am just wondering if anyone has some convincing counterarguments to these criticisms and a lot of others, instead of just saying the people who make these arguments are ignorant or uneducated (though some may be).\nif you have any other criticisms of btc feel free to share, and i would love to hear some rebuttals to other common claims made by the likes of r/technology.",Industry,0

(you are god). based on that it is safer to say ""i invest in the top x coins"" instead of saying i only invest in coin x and coin y.\n2. investing in altcoins in addition to btc can increase your roi considerably. investing in top 7-10 coins tends to yield the most return in this case study (x3).\n3. based on #2, a crypto etf (or a similar service from exchanges that allow us to buy in bulk) could give exposure to the top x coins while saving transaction costs considerably.\n\nif you want more details, here is what your wallet would look like in each case of the above:\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ note:** this whole case study was a fun project and i was trying to answer some questions and thought to share it with you in case that would help you in any way. also it is important to not that history does not dictate the future, so please take all of what i present here with a grain of salt.\n\nmuch love!

"is bitcoin is value solely based on the greater fool theory? disclaimer: i actually hold btc myself as an investment, but i'm really wondering what intrinsic value and use case bitcoin has.\njust to clarify, i do understand most of the technical details of bitcoin like mining, proof of work and the 21 million cap. \nthe greater fool theory is basically the idea that the price of an asset is determined by how much others are willing to pay for it. basically people buy something because they can sell it for more to a greater fool, who then hopes they can sell it to an even greater fool thus leading to the price continuing to grow as more and more people buy in. i'm sure we've all seen the likes of r/technology calling this ponzi/pyramid/mlm which isn't exactly what it is, but the idea is the same. \ni'm playing devil is advocate here, but what really sets btc apart from speculative bubbles like dutch tulips or beanie babies? as in why would you buy bitcoin other than hoping to sell it for more later? it was originally intended to be electronic cash but it obviously didn't go that route. \nif you say it is a store of value (which i understand why) it doesn't seem to hold stable value as of present, like precious metals do. will the price stabilise in the future or do we just hope it will?\nif you say the lack of barriers to easily transfer value anywhere in the world, there is plenty of much more efficient blockchain technologies that do it much better than btc.\nif you say decentralisation, that is not what the majority are buying btc for. they (including many of us) just want to make money. how much intrinsic value does it really provide?\njust to reiterate, i'm not against bitcoin. i am just wondering if anyone has some convincing counterarguments to these criticisms and a lot of others, instead of just saying the people who make these arguments are ignorant or uneducated (though some may be).\nif you have any other criticisms of btc feel free to share, and i would love to hear some rebuttals to other common claims made by the likes of r/technology.","Rare and limited supply makes no difference unless someone wants to buy it.

So I can technically receive all of that $500 on a DeX, not report that income or any further profits I make on it. But if I want to convert it to INR, does DeXs support P2P? How wud I get INR in my bank let's say after an year or two.\n\n2. If I use DeXs, then they mostly support normal spot trading. I like to do Futures trading.

Is this understanding correct? I faced an issue earlier where I transferred USDT over TRC20 and pancakeswap was showing my USDT balance as 0. So FOR ANY coin on pancakeswap, if I get it on BEP20, pancakeswap will allow me to use it for farms/pools? When I open Trust wallet, I can see the BNB and Cake over BEP20 but Dot or Link doesn't show any network. Is it by default BEP20? If I want to use Dot-BNB farm on pancakeswap, how should I get Dot in my trust wallet such that it shows as non-zero balance on pancakeswap?\n\n4. Also which wallet wud u recommend out of Trust wallet or binance wallet (not metamask due to huge fees). I am more inclined towards Trust wallet because I already am using it but if BSC wallet has more benefits, pls enlighten me.\n\nWhat should be the right way to go about it?

Gradually because we don't know where is the peak might as well leave some to ride the price. And the emphasis on PROFIT you want to sell above your costs.\n3. You will make some mistakes. This is normal. Everyone does mistakes. So I suggest you put in small amounts first because learning from these mistakes could be very expensive.\n4. Price will never always go up. Price also will never always go down. \n5. When in doubt zoom out on the overall chart.\n6. Fear and greed can be your ally if you use them properly.",0
"do you think any project will ever overtake bitcoin and ethereum by marketcap? bitcoin is king and ethereum is queen in the crypto space right now. they both are gargantuan market caps and are the two cryptos that even the average person has probably heard of.\n\nwe know that with technology, advancements are made at rapid paces and revolutionary pieces of technology are being worked on everyday. now i know that it isnt always the best tech that wins because marketing, first mover advantage etc play a role. however, i do think the cream will rise to the top as more and more people get educated about crypto.\n\nwe all talk about the flippening aka eth taking over btc in marketcap. however, do you see any alts overtaking both in the long term? obviously if this is to ever happen, the project that achieves it would have to have exceptional utility, marketing and be ready to be applied in the real world. what are yours thoughts? could this ever happen? which project has the potential to flip both?",QNT in 2025,0

"social skills 101 for crypto bros saw a question on askmen subreddit ""what is the male version of astrology girl?"" and to no one is surprise crypto dude is one of the top answers.\n\nlet is be real here, we people who are into crypto have a bad reputation socially. we are at best socially inept, at worst cult-like. the stereotype of the crypto bros is one who tries to 'teach' them about crypto, and get them to convert their hard earned money to the sacred crypto. i have been on dates and the moment i talk about crypto, i can literal feel her pants tighten up, and help her remember that she has something important came up and need to end the date early.\n\nto help with dispelling this negative image of crypto bros, i decided to write up this post on how to improve our social skills with people.\n\nthe fundamental issue with crypto bros is basing his entire identity around crypto itself. to be fair, basing one is identity to a single thing, like religion, politics, work etc. is a horrible idea. life is a lot more than just crypto; have some fun hobbies, be proactive in your professional career, be involved in friends and families' lives. i get that you're passionate about crypto and how it will change your life, that doesn't mean you have to shove it down into other people is throat. it is like that annoying christian dude that won't shut up about jesus and somehow connecting every conversational topic to him.\n\ni am not advocating for people to actively hide the fact that they're into crypto, if it comes out in a conversation, it comes out. there is a huge difference in responding to the question ""what are you into?"" with ""i'm really into my job (or ""working towards my dream job"" if you hate your job), i'm into (some hobby), and like to trade some crypto on the side."" vs ""oh i'm really into crypto!"" followed by a 1 hour lecture on crypto. what i'm saying is that it is important to be a well-rounded person and not basing your entire identity on crypto alone.\n\nan unhealthy mentality crypto bros have is what i call the 'red pill' mentality, where they feel superior just because they're into crypto and the person they're talking to isn't. this same mentality is also commonly found in cults, conspiracy nuts and anti-vaxxers.\n\nanother important thing, read their body language. if when talking about crypto and you can see they're no longer attentive like looking away or just looking dead in the eye, change the topic. this applies to any conversational topic. if they're not into what you're into, that is ok. if they're interested in crypto, naturally they'll ask you more about it.\n\nremember a social interaction is a two-way street, where you share about what you're into, they share theirs, and establishing commonalities. it is not you shoving down your isuperior' crypto ways into their throats.",Skills: Ok.  \n\n\nSocial?

so i am buying some coins.... any recommendations by investors? i am mining at the moment with nicehash just having a bit of fun with a gaming pc.\n\nso i have purchased 50 dodge coins today after it dropped like crazy. who thinks it will pick up?\n\ni also purchased some ethereum..... some meaning about $25 nzd worth. \n\nand keeping a little in bitcoin just to differentiate the amounts and coins i am investing in.\n\nthoughts on this?,"Sounds good. Ethereum is definitely the best bet in my opinion. That coin has been wonderful to me this year. I also think doge will definitely go up just because of the memes, but who knows how long it will take to reach the 70s again. I feel like other coins might have better potential but if youre able, stocking up on doge isnt a bad idea at all. \n\nLitecoin has also been doing good for me this year. It recently dipped too so keeping an eye on it for a chance to get in is a good plan IMO. Chain link has also been great for me within the past month. It did reach an ath recently so Id keep an eye on it and wait for a dip if I were you. But I see that coin reaching ~500 within the next 10 years, maybe even higher. I obviously cant predict the future so the opposite can also happen lol.\n\nThere are a lot of coins with good potential. I think whatever you put money into, as long as its not being pumped with no utility, youll see returns in the upcoming years as crypto becomes more mainstream.",1

"which is better: buying top coins vs. buying btc &amp; eth - (a 6 years dca case study) inspired by [this post]( i built a script to analyse if you dca'd blindly in the top crypto coins vs. investing in btc &amp; eth vs investing only in btc since the beginning of 2015, how much would your total worth is. here are the results.\n\n**numbers &amp; assumptions:**\n\n* dcaing takes place every week, on 1st, 8th, 15th and 22th of every month starting from jan 1st 2015 and until july 6th 2021.\n* investments budget per week is $100.\n* the weekly investment is divided equally on the coins invested in.\n* this case study is ignoring stable coin investments. e.g.: investing in the top 5 coins means the top 5 coins excluding any stable coins.\n* the analysis is assuming that you invested your money and never sold any coin till now.\n* total invested money over the whole dca period is $31,300.\n* transaction fees are not included in the analysis.\n\n**here are the results:**\n\n* if you blindly dca into the top 1 coins (btc), you will end up with **$1,102,104**.\n* if you blindly dca into the top 2 coins, you will end up with 4 coins (btc, xrp, ltc, eth) in your wallet and total worth of **$1,462,443**.\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 3 coins**, you will end up with 11 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,310,552.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 5 coins**, you will end up with 23 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,490,189.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 7 coins**, you will end up with 37 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,923,849.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 10 coins**, you will end up with 55 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,316,169.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 20 coins**, you will end up with 130 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,619,756.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 50 coins**, you will end up with 381 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$979,086.**\n* if you had a glass ball and knew that eth will be what it is today and you invested only in btc &amp; eth, you will end up with 2 coins in your wallet (surprise), and a total worth of **$4,505,477.**\n\n**some observations:**\n\n1. although it was relatively easier to guess that btc will be the #1 crypto coin back then, nobody would have guessed for sure that eth will be #2, so betting on btc &amp; eth only from the beginning would've been your strategy only if you know the future. (you are god). based on that it is safer to say ""i invest in the top x coins"" instead of saying i only invest in coin x and coin y.\n2. investing in altcoins in addition to btc can increase your roi considerably. investing in top 7-10 coins tends to yield the most return in this case study (x3).\n3. based on #2, a crypto etf (or a similar service from exchanges that allow us to buy in bulk) could give exposure to the top x coins while saving transaction costs considerably.\n\nif you want more details, here is what your wallet would look like in each case of the above:\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ note:** this whole case study was a fun project and i was trying to answer some questions and thought to share it with you in case that would help you in any way. also it is important to not that history does not dictate the future, so please take all of what i present here with a grain of salt.\n\nmuch love!

"Question about Bitcoin So I've been aware of Bitcoin for a long time now but I've always been a sceptic, this is probably going to be downvoted or called FUD. This would be a great time to ""buy the dip"" according to many but I can't find good arguments to my question so I figured I'd ask here. \n\nHow is this different from a ponzi scheme? People can only make money from people paying more in the future so any money I'd make is from someone buying hoping someone else would pay more, right? Not only that but money also dissapear from costs of mining and taxes. So for people to make 1 million other people have to spend more than that. How will this ever possibly change? According to information I can find a small amount of wallets contain a majority of all the Bitcoin so it doesn't sound like it's a wealth distributor either. \n\nYeah yeah, OP is just posting FUD and wouldn't want to buy Bitcoin anyways. Sure, if nobody can give me a good answer to this I won't.","I mean sure, but the majority of people talking about Bitcoin are promising future returns and saying this is just the beginning. That's about the price (value) of Bitcoin. I guess it's what happens when it explodes in value quickly but I'm under the impression that most people talking about ""buy the dip"" and ""HODL"" want and expect a future value that makes them rich. That's the point when talking about it as an investment, which is what most people value it as.\n\nAlso, rare doesn't mean valuable so I don't see how that's a good selling point. It only has the value people give it and most people seem to give it value in hopes of cashing in on even greater returns later. If those returns is 200% in three months or people able to become financial gods if the dollar dies in 20xx doesn't really matter to me, both are trying to get others to buy into something for their own gain.",0

Crypto tax Q A (U.S. tax),"There is no requirement for there to be a fair market exchange for something to be taxable.  A piece of art may not have a fair market exchange, but you can bet the IRS will want whatever gain is realized on its sale.  Being on the dark web is also irrelevant (there are also social media sites on the normal web where you can purchase V-bucks).  There is also no requirement to take your claimed v-bucks and exchange them back to cash for there to be a tax realization.  Even a barter is subject to capital gains/loss rules.  There is also no requirement for V-bucks to be used to pay for real world goods/services for it to be taxable.\n\nThe bottom line is: under current U.S. tax code, V-bucks would be taxable, both at the time of earning them (under income tax rules), and at the time of exchanging them (under capital gains tax rules).\n\nI'm underscoring the fact that the U.S. tax code is messed up.",0

"how do you find/choose your favorite yolo alt/shitcoins? still fairly new to crypto investing and trying to slowly grow my portfolio. currently have a biweekly dca purchase strategy of:\n\n40% eth\n20% btc\n15% ada\n15% amp\n10% algo\n\nhowever, i'd like to throw some money very occasionally at a more obscure low cost alt or shitcoin strictly as a lottery play. i know there is inherit risk in all of crypto, even with the biggest projects, and obscure coins are exponentially more risky, but sometimes people are able to choose wisely (or get lucky) and get in early enough to enjoy huge returns.\n\nmy question is, if this is something that you also like to entertain once in a while, how exactly do you personally go about finding and then selecting those types of coins to take a flyer on? obviously, i want to be as discerning as possible, but i'm also concerned that if i wait for too much momentum to build, i might not be an early enough adopter to really ride that big growth wave that we all dream about.\n\ncurious to hear your approach!","Nice, same here, it's still undervalued in my opinion though, 350m market cap even with the 25% pump this week, a lot of space to grow, plus I hope the swap will pump the price higher too in a few days, if they don't mess it up.",0
"question on small business accepting crypto i have a small business and want to start accepting payment in crypto. i receive payment by invoicing online (mainly through paypal and zelle), not in person. i would like to start accepting payment in crypto. i hold some crypto in coinbase, so i thought that might be easiest to use. however in looking through other posts i see others advising bitpay, and a few others for quickness and fees. anyone have advise on the best way to offer clients to pay?\n\nthanks for any help!",Stellar is good.

When its dropping I hesitate to buy because it could drop further, then in hindsight you wish you'd have bought. Then at the peaks it's so hard to know when to take profits. DCA in seems to be the best option for me personally as it mitigates trying to time an unpredictable market.",0

"social skills 101 for crypto bros saw a question on askmen subreddit ""what is the male version of astrology girl?"" and to no one is surprise crypto dude is one of the top answers.\n\nlet is be real here, we people who are into crypto have a bad reputation socially. we are at best socially inept, at worst cult-like. the stereotype of the crypto bros is one who tries to 'teach' them about crypto, and get them to convert their hard earned money to the sacred crypto. i have been on dates and the moment i talk about crypto, i can literal feel her pants tighten up, and help her remember that she has something important came up and need to end the date early.\n\nto help with dispelling this negative image of crypto bros, i decided to write up this post on how to improve our social skills with people.\n\nthe fundamental issue with crypto bros is basing his entire identity around crypto itself. to be fair, basing one is identity to a single thing, like religion, politics, work etc. is a horrible idea. life is a lot more than just crypto; have some fun hobbies, be proactive in your professional career, be involved in friends and families' lives. i get that you're passionate about crypto and how it will change your life, that doesn't mean you have to shove it down into other people is throat. it is like that annoying christian dude that won't shut up about jesus and somehow connecting every conversational topic to him.\n\ni am not advocating for people to actively hide the fact that they're into crypto, if it comes out in a conversation, it comes out. there is a huge difference in responding to the question ""what are you into?"" with ""i'm really into my job (or ""working towards my dream job"" if you hate your job), i'm into (some hobby), and like to trade some crypto on the side."" vs ""oh i'm really into crypto!"" followed by a 1 hour lecture on crypto. what i'm saying is that it is important to be a well-rounded person and not basing your entire identity on crypto alone.\n\nan unhealthy mentality crypto bros have is what i call the 'red pill' mentality, where they feel superior just because they're into crypto and the person they're talking to isn't. this same mentality is also commonly found in cults, conspiracy nuts and anti-vaxxers.\n\nanother important thing, read their body language. if when talking about crypto and you can see they're no longer attentive like looking away or just looking dead in the eye, change the topic. this applies to any conversational topic. if they're not into what you're into, that is ok. if they're interested in crypto, naturally they'll ask you more about it.\n\nremember a social interaction is a two-way street, where you share about what you're into, they share theirs, and establishing commonalities. it is not you shoving down your isuperior' crypto ways into their throats.",Crysus,0

Exchange recommendations will change with time and depends where you're at.

"social skills 101 for crypto bros saw a question on askmen subreddit ""what is the male version of astrology girl?"" and to no one is surprise crypto dude is one of the top answers.\n\nlet is be real here, we people who are into crypto have a bad reputation socially. we are at best socially inept, at worst cult-like. the stereotype of the crypto bros is one who tries to 'teach' them about crypto, and get them to convert their hard earned money to the sacred crypto. i have been on dates and the moment i talk about crypto, i can literal feel her pants tighten up, and help her remember that she has something important came up and need to end the date early.\n\nto help with dispelling this negative image of crypto bros, i decided to write up this post on how to improve our social skills with people.\n\nthe fundamental issue with crypto bros is basing his entire identity around crypto itself. to be fair, basing one is identity to a single thing, like religion, politics, work etc. is a horrible idea. life is a lot more than just crypto; have some fun hobbies, be proactive in your professional career, be involved in friends and families' lives. i get that you're passionate about crypto and how it will change your life, that doesn't mean you have to shove it down into other people is throat. it is like that annoying christian dude that won't shut up about jesus and somehow connecting every conversational topic to him.\n\ni am not advocating for people to actively hide the fact that they're into crypto, if it comes out in a conversation, it comes out. there is a huge difference in responding to the question ""what are you into?"" with ""i'm really into my job (or ""working towards my dream job"" if you hate your job), i'm into (some hobby), and like to trade some crypto on the side."" vs ""oh i'm really into crypto!"" followed by a 1 hour lecture on crypto. what i'm saying is that it is important to be a well-rounded person and not basing your entire identity on crypto alone.\n\nan unhealthy mentality crypto bros have is what i call the 'red pill' mentality, where they feel superior just because they're into crypto and the person they're talking to isn't. this same mentality is also commonly found in cults, conspiracy nuts and anti-vaxxers.\n\nanother important thing, read their body language. if when talking about crypto and you can see they're no longer attentive like looking away or just looking dead in the eye, change the topic. this applies to any conversational topic. if they're not into what you're into, that is ok. if they're interested in crypto, naturally they'll ask you more about it.\n\nremember a social interaction is a two-way street, where you share about what you're into, they share theirs, and establishing commonalities. it is not you shoving down your isuperior' crypto ways into their throats.",You're welcome!

(you are god). based on that it is safer to say ""i invest in the top x coins"" instead of saying i only invest in coin x and coin y.\n2. investing in altcoins in addition to btc can increase your roi considerably. investing in top 7-10 coins tends to yield the most return in this case study (x3).\n3. based on #2, a crypto etf (or a similar service from exchanges that allow us to buy in bulk) could give exposure to the top x coins while saving transaction costs considerably.\n\nif you want more details, here is what your wallet would look like in each case of the above:\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ note:** this whole case study was a fun project and i was trying to answer some questions and thought to share it with you in case that would help you in any way. also it is important to not that history does not dictate the future, so please take all of what i present here with a grain of salt.\n\nmuch love!

"isn't cross-chain compatibility the future? then why are interoperability coins so undervalued? it seems that every blockchain is doing its own thing, trying to dominate nfts, defi or consolidate value only to its own coin or token, but that is not the way of the future. \n\nright now the the major challenge that blockchain technology is facing is the lack of interoperability, or the lack of cross-chain compatibility. \n\nthe projects that are working hard to address those issues--the biggest names out there would be polkadot (dot), cosmos (atom) and chainlink (link)--are severely undervalued imho compared to other chains out there. \n\neach blockchain project has different characteristics that prevent them from communicating with eachother, unconnected to other chains, preventing it from reaching its true potential of interconnectedness; which would allow integration with existing systems, being able to initiate transactions on other networks and conducting interchain transactions with much lower gas fees. \n\nif interoperability is the game-changer for the blockchain industry and the key to mass adoption, then why are all of these projects so severely undervalued? that is my question.","You should take a look at AtomicDEX [https://www.atomicdex.io](https://www.atomicdex.io)  \nIt links all this chains together, because you can atomic swap tokens between chains, directly from wallet to wallet, without any bridges or other intermediaries.  \nIt supports UTXO native chains too, like BTC, LTC and so on, so you can do a direct swap between LTC and USDC-AVX20 (Avalanche) for example.",0

"Is transferring trx to FTX exchange from CoinDCX and then converting to USD to purchase crypto illegal?**Premise**\n\nGiven the volatile situation with a lot of exchanges halting withdrawals of cryptos, especially in India, in order to safeguard my investments, I wanted to devise an approach to offload my crypto to a cold wallet. I do intend to hold long-term and am not interested in trading.\n\n**Approach**\n\nSo I figured the best thing to do was as follows\n\n1. Open an account with Binance or FTX\n2. Since CoinDCX doesn't allow direct withdrawal of cryptos except for BTC and TRX, sell my positions (which are at a severe loss) for INR on CoinDCX and purchase an equivalent amount of TRX on CoinDCX eg. Sell XRP for INR, and buy TRX with the INR amount.\n3. Transfer the TRX from CoinDCX to Binance/FTX\n4. Convert the TRX to USD on Binance/FTX\n5. Purchase the same value of the sold asset using USD (either through spot or a DCA over a period of time for the relevant USD value)\n6. Once I have purchased the crypto, directly move the crypto to my cold wallet\n\n**Question**\n\nI am keeping a track of each sale and purchase and it's INR value so I can keep aside the 1% TDS to then pay at the end of the year. I also do understand that when I do finally sell, I will need to pay 30% tax on any profit I make on the sale. \n\nHowever, I wanted to understand if the approach I am taking is fine or is it problematic from a legal/tax perspective\n\nI know this is a new situation we have in India so I genuinely appreciate the advice\n\nThanks in Advance",I keep the USD on the exchange and use it to make DCA payments towards my cryptos,0

"when transferring coins between exchanges, use xlm to be able to move around with virtually no fees! just started doing this recently and realised i couldve saved myself hundreds in fees if i had begun to do this earlier. its especially great if youre constantly moving around smaller amounts between exchanges and youre a frequent buyer of smaller cap coins from exchanges like kucoin like me. ill list the fees/withdrawal limits to give everyone a practical idea of how it works\n\nminimum binance withdrawal for btc is currently 0.001 which is ~40. every transacation comes at a cost of 0.0005 btc which is ~20/$28, meaning if youre looking to withdraw around 200/$280 youre already around 10% down. over time if youre frequently looking to buy smaller coins not listed on major, this really starts to add up.\n\nsimilarly with eth, minimum withdrawal amount is 0.016 which is ~45/$63 with a fee of 0.005 on every transaction which is around 15/$21 every transaction, looking to withdraw 200/$280 there and youre down around 8%.\n\nlooking at xlm, minimum withdrawal amount is 40 which is ~16/$22 at current prices. a what really stands out though is the transaction fee, youre looking at an 0.02 fee every time which is less than 0.01! \n\nthe great thing about xlm is that its also available on the vast majority of exchanges, so converting it back after is super easy. there are other coins which work with the tiny fees, but in terms of availability they arent always listed across exchanges so xlm is the perfect middle ground.",XLM,0

"since crypto fluctuates would loaning real money be more effective? this sounds like a ploy but i swear it is not, i'm simply using my actual circumstance as an illustrative example in order to ask a question i've always had about cryptocurrency...\n\nso i'm getting settled into a new job right now, \nand all of my budget is currently pre-allotted.\n\ni'd need a near $4000 loan today so i could get accommodations in time for a last minute trip that i believe would jumpstart my content creation career monumentally.\nbeing that i have no credit history, to borrow that money from a corporate lender would be virtually impossible!\n\nso at this point i realized that, i'm actually willing to reimburse literally anyone $4000 plus at least 25% interest ($1000 return) over the next five months as a form of a personal loan.\n\nthis made me wonder how the return on that compares to the return on something that fluctuates as much as crypto, would the return on a loan be more instantaneous, higher, and more financially certain, or no? \n\nhow would a scenario like this where you certainly gain $200 each month compare to your averages in the crypto trade? is it lower risk since you could lose money on a crypto investment if you sell at the wrong time, or would the low profit not be worth it?","Don't loan money to banks, to your family, or even on crypto exchanges.

risk of crypto after wide adoption. first of all i love crypto like the rest of this sub but for whatever reason i keep thinking about this.\n\nafter crypto is widely adopted and the whole world has wallets or methods of sending/receiving crypto is there not a higher risk of strong armed robbery?\n\nwhat prevents someone with a gun from completely cleaning you out in about 5 minutes.\n\nif anyone thinks this could be a non issue please let me know your thoughts.,"Damn man, First people were saying crypto is bad because it's used to buy drugs and now you think you could possible be robbed at gun point.

"which crypto is used the most frequently as currency to purchase goods/services? i can't seem to find this on google; searching these terms often result in market cap, so bitcoin. \n\nhowever i'm more interested in which of the crypto coins are used to purchase actual goods or services; specifically in terms of frequency and not necessary total amount. the reason is because if a someone purchases a million dollar usd car with coin x then that would offset/mask say another coin that has over 100k transactions from smaller transaction &lt; 1-2 usd, say to purchase groceries. \n\nis there a way to find an answer to this? for example is there a site that tracks number of transactions to purchase rather as a trade. is this even possible? \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n thanks in advance.","The home video analogy is apt in a general sense, but I don't think finding an answer will help you if you're looking to make a long-term play based on this info. I say this because unlike betamax/vhs/laser disc/DVD scenario, crypto is going to have to be under the purview of governments for it to be widely used for transactions. Peer to peer payments like sending a friend $100 won't need that to happen, but businesses with various licenses absolutely need to comply with local and federal laws if they want to avoid serious problems. In other words, there's not really a free market situation when it comes to using crypto as a currency because governments are not going to allow their tax base to switch to a new currency en masse. \n\nIf this wasn't the case, I'd say the early adoption winner would be the coin that makes it easiest to use. This would need to include secure wallets that make it easy to find a business or individual (no copy/pasting long addresses), and I think it would need a way to swap the coin to a stablecoin or fiat immediately to avoid one side losing value quickly.\n\nAfter typing this, I'm thinking I need to keep an eye on what Visa and Mastercard are doing with crypto. Whatever they choose is likely to do well because if your coin is involved in the two largest credit card companies in the world, it instantly has access to the largest market in the world.",0

B I cant take it.  Ive explained this 1,000 times and people keep asking the same,naive at best, questions.\n\nEdit: The rebuttal on 4 doesnt sound like a rebuttal.  It sounds like an admission that there is a real valuable feature, its not the greater fool, but then changing the subject to But other cryptocurrencies provide privacy and similar services that compete with Bitcoin in this area.  When I ask you if a McDonalds franchise is worth running or if its just a scam from the parent franchiser, and you tell me why its not a scam, I dont get to rebuttal by saying But Wendys and Chipotle are doing better in certain areas competing or outperforming McDonalds, therefore, McDonalds is in fact a scam afterall.  Strawman argument in disguise.  Because other blockchains exist that do certain things better than Bitcoin doesnt mean Bitcoin is suddenly just a play on selling to the larger fool.\n\nAnd FWIW, dont underestimate Bitcoin and Ethereumthey have waaaaay more devs and hardcore users  who will use them for life no matter what else comes out, never jump ship until the day they die, and will be committed to always improving BTC/ETH networks and protocols.  You may not run in these circles and only run in circles of speculative investors, but BTC and ETH have *massive* hardcore lifers who use the networks, validate on the networks, develop on the networks, and so on in addition to the speculative investors, whereas some other projects that do things better have only a dozen or so hardcore junkies, and a bunch of speculators and may find it hard to gain traction via network effects.  The better tech doesnt always win if 100x more people are committed to the less superior tech, have skin in the game and so on.  In fact, sometimes the less superior technology will then widen the gap.  Personally, I think overall market share will be lost, but BTC/ETH will remain fairly dominant (or big movers and shakers at least) for many decades to come.

Given that you deposited an ERC20 token, it's reasonable that you had to pay $~8 in network fees, because Ethereum transaction fees are insane.

"which is better: buying top coins vs. buying btc &amp; eth - (a 6 years dca case study) inspired by [this post]( i built a script to analyse if you dca'd blindly in the top crypto coins vs. investing in btc &amp; eth vs investing only in btc since the beginning of 2015, how much would your total worth is. here are the results.\n\n**numbers &amp; assumptions:**\n\n* dcaing takes place every week, on 1st, 8th, 15th and 22th of every month starting from jan 1st 2015 and until july 6th 2021.\n* investments budget per week is $100.\n* the weekly investment is divided equally on the coins invested in.\n* this case study is ignoring stable coin investments. e.g.: investing in the top 5 coins means the top 5 coins excluding any stable coins.\n* the analysis is assuming that you invested your money and never sold any coin till now.\n* total invested money over the whole dca period is $31,300.\n* transaction fees are not included in the analysis.\n\n**here are the results:**\n\n* if you blindly dca into the top 1 coins (btc), you will end up with **$1,102,104**.\n* if you blindly dca into the top 2 coins, you will end up with 4 coins (btc, xrp, ltc, eth) in your wallet and total worth of **$1,462,443**.\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 3 coins**, you will end up with 11 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,310,552.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 5 coins**, you will end up with 23 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,490,189.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 7 coins**, you will end up with 37 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,923,849.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 10 coins**, you will end up with 55 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,316,169.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 20 coins**, you will end up with 130 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,619,756.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 50 coins**, you will end up with 381 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$979,086.**\n* if you had a glass ball and knew that eth will be what it is today and you invested only in btc &amp; eth, you will end up with 2 coins in your wallet (surprise), and a total worth of **$4,505,477.**\n\n**some observations:**\n\n1. although it was relatively easier to guess that btc will be the #1 crypto coin back then, nobody would have guessed for sure that eth will be #2, so betting on btc &amp; eth only from the beginning would've been your strategy only if you know the future. (you are god). based on that it is safer to say ""i invest in the top x coins"" instead of saying i only invest in coin x and coin y.\n2. investing in altcoins in addition to btc can increase your roi considerably. investing in top 7-10 coins tends to yield the most return in this case study (x3).\n3. based on #2, a crypto etf (or a similar service from exchanges that allow us to buy in bulk) could give exposure to the top x coins while saving transaction costs considerably.\n\nif you want more details, here is what your wallet would look like in each case of the above:\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ note:** this whole case study was a fun project and i was trying to answer some questions and thought to share it with you in case that would help you in any way. also it is important to not that history does not dictate the future, so please take all of what i present here with a grain of salt.\n\nmuch love!

"is bitcoin is value solely based on the greater fool theory? disclaimer: i actually hold btc myself as an investment, but i'm really wondering what intrinsic value and use case bitcoin has.\njust to clarify, i do understand most of the technical details of bitcoin like mining, proof of work and the 21 million cap. \nthe greater fool theory is basically the idea that the price of an asset is determined by how much others are willing to pay for it. basically people buy something because they can sell it for more to a greater fool, who then hopes they can sell it to an even greater fool thus leading to the price continuing to grow as more and more people buy in. i'm sure we've all seen the likes of r/technology calling this ponzi/pyramid/mlm which isn't exactly what it is, but the idea is the same. \ni'm playing devil is advocate here, but what really sets btc apart from speculative bubbles like dutch tulips or beanie babies? as in why would you buy bitcoin other than hoping to sell it for more later? it was originally intended to be electronic cash but it obviously didn't go that route. \nif you say it is a store of value (which i understand why) it doesn't seem to hold stable value as of present, like precious metals do. will the price stabilise in the future or do we just hope it will?\nif you say the lack of barriers to easily transfer value anywhere in the world, there is plenty of much more efficient blockchain technologies that do it much better than btc.\nif you say decentralisation, that is not what the majority are buying btc for. they (including many of us) just want to make money. how much intrinsic value does it really provide?\njust to reiterate, i'm not against bitcoin. i am just wondering if anyone has some convincing counterarguments to these criticisms and a lot of others, instead of just saying the people who make these arguments are ignorant or uneducated (though some may be).\nif you have any other criticisms of btc feel free to share, and i would love to hear some rebuttals to other common claims made by the likes of r/technology.",Its not worthless.

"which is better: buying top coins vs. buying btc &amp; eth - (a 6 years dca case study) inspired by [this post]( i built a script to analyse if you dca'd blindly in the top crypto coins vs. investing in btc &amp; eth vs investing only in btc since the beginning of 2015, how much would your total worth is. here are the results.\n\n**numbers &amp; assumptions:**\n\n* dcaing takes place every week, on 1st, 8th, 15th and 22th of every month starting from jan 1st 2015 and until july 6th 2021.\n* investments budget per week is $100.\n* the weekly investment is divided equally on the coins invested in.\n* this case study is ignoring stable coin investments. e.g.: investing in the top 5 coins means the top 5 coins excluding any stable coins.\n* the analysis is assuming that you invested your money and never sold any coin till now.\n* total invested money over the whole dca period is $31,300.\n* transaction fees are not included in the analysis.\n\n**here are the results:**\n\n* if you blindly dca into the top 1 coins (btc), you will end up with **$1,102,104**.\n* if you blindly dca into the top 2 coins, you will end up with 4 coins (btc, xrp, ltc, eth) in your wallet and total worth of **$1,462,443**.\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 3 coins**, you will end up with 11 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,310,552.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 5 coins**, you will end up with 23 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,490,189.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 7 coins**, you will end up with 37 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,923,849.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 10 coins**, you will end up with 55 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,316,169.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 20 coins**, you will end up with 130 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,619,756.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 50 coins**, you will end up with 381 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$979,086.**\n* if you had a glass ball and knew that eth will be what it is today and you invested only in btc &amp; eth, you will end up with 2 coins in your wallet (surprise), and a total worth of **$4,505,477.**\n\n**some observations:**\n\n1. although it was relatively easier to guess that btc will be the #1 crypto coin back then, nobody would have guessed for sure that eth will be #2, so betting on btc &amp; eth only from the beginning would've been your strategy only if you know the future. (you are god). based on that it is safer to say ""i invest in the top x coins"" instead of saying i only invest in coin x and coin y.\n2. investing in altcoins in addition to btc can increase your roi considerably. investing in top 7-10 coins tends to yield the most return in this case study (x3).\n3. based on #2, a crypto etf (or a similar service from exchanges that allow us to buy in bulk) could give exposure to the top x coins while saving transaction costs considerably.\n\nif you want more details, here is what your wallet would look like in each case of the above:\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ note:** this whole case study was a fun project and i was trying to answer some questions and thought to share it with you in case that would help you in any way. also it is important to not that history does not dictate the future, so please take all of what i present here with a grain of salt.\n\nmuch love!

"which is better: buying top coins vs. buying btc &amp; eth - (a 6 years dca case study) inspired by [this post]( i built a script to analyse if you dca'd blindly in the top crypto coins vs. investing in btc &amp; eth vs investing only in btc since the beginning of 2015, how much would your total worth is. here are the results.\n\n**numbers &amp; assumptions:**\n\n* dcaing takes place every week, on 1st, 8th, 15th and 22th of every month starting from jan 1st 2015 and until july 6th 2021.\n* investments budget per week is $100.\n* the weekly investment is divided equally on the coins invested in.\n* this case study is ignoring stable coin investments. e.g.: investing in the top 5 coins means the top 5 coins excluding any stable coins.\n* the analysis is assuming that you invested your money and never sold any coin till now.\n* total invested money over the whole dca period is $31,300.\n* transaction fees are not included in the analysis.\n\n**here are the results:**\n\n* if you blindly dca into the top 1 coins (btc), you will end up with **$1,102,104**.\n* if you blindly dca into the top 2 coins, you will end up with 4 coins (btc, xrp, ltc, eth) in your wallet and total worth of **$1,462,443**.\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 3 coins**, you will end up with 11 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,310,552.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 5 coins**, you will end up with 23 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,490,189.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 7 coins**, you will end up with 37 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,923,849.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 10 coins**, you will end up with 55 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,316,169.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 20 coins**, you will end up with 130 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,619,756.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 50 coins**, you will end up with 381 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$979,086.**\n* if you had a glass ball and knew that eth will be what it is today and you invested only in btc &amp; eth, you will end up with 2 coins in your wallet (surprise), and a total worth of **$4,505,477.**\n\n**some observations:**\n\n1. although it was relatively easier to guess that btc will be the #1 crypto coin back then, nobody would have guessed for sure that eth will be #2, so betting on btc &amp; eth only from the beginning would've been your strategy only if you know the future. (you are god). based on that it is safer to say ""i invest in the top x coins"" instead of saying i only invest in coin x and coin y.\n2. investing in altcoins in addition to btc can increase your roi considerably. investing in top 7-10 coins tends to yield the most return in this case study (x3).\n3. based on #2, a crypto etf (or a similar service from exchanges that allow us to buy in bulk) could give exposure to the top x coins while saving transaction costs considerably.\n\nif you want more details, here is what your wallet would look like in each case of the above:\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ note:** this whole case study was a fun project and i was trying to answer some questions and thought to share it with you in case that would help you in any way. also it is important to not that history does not dictate the future, so please take all of what i present here with a grain of salt.\n\nmuch love!

"how does one know if a coin is overpriced? i was wondering what formulas or stuff you guys looked at to determine if a certain coin was overpriced. i usually do market cap/max supply and compare it with market cap/supply right now, but i dont think thats the correct formula/way to determine if a coin is over/under priced.","Most coins it's hard to say\n\nSome you can make reasonable guesses at the value if you're willing to math it out with your own assumptions. \n\nFor example, I remember doing this for OMG in 2017 when a friend got me interested in it. The parent company Omise had said they would move their existing payment gateways merchants to OmiseGo when it was ready. We knew the rough volume of transactions they processed. So with an estimate of the rough transaction size, some comparisons with Eth fees, I could get an earnings/year type figure and with a reasonable PE ratio assumption find what I thought the token would be worth if the network achieved that goal. If you weigh that against the odds of them reaching that goal, that can help you determine if it's value is too high or low.\n\nOther tokens like Siacoin are harder. I know what their service costs in $... I don't really need to preload on a bunch of Sia because I could always just buy $1 at a time and it'd last me forever given my usage... So, it feels more like a guess than an estimate to put any specifics value on it.",0

For really long term storage, use archival-grade paper.\n\nAnother approach to take is using a separate computer for storing your money that is offline 99+% of the time. You could set one up easily by buying an old laptop, reformatting it, installing Linux and a Bitcoin client. Generate an address on that machine and send money to it from your main wallet.

what are some good gaming projects in the crypto space that we should be looking into? recently there has been a lot of talk about axie infinity which looks great but a big issue seems to be the cost of entry that is preventing a lot of people from jumping onboard. what are some other gaming projects with earning potential in the crypto space that we should consider looking into or jumping on board?,"> What are some other gaming projects with earning potential in the crypto space that we should consider looking into or jumping on board? And why?\n\nI personally believe open-ended MMOs are the holy grail of crypto. Not slapped on via NFTs or some money-making venture, but integrated from the ground up. That means in-game rules, interactions, everything on the blockchain.\n\nMMOs are expensive to build however, open-world MMOs even more so. Nonetheless, it will probably be built eventually.\n\nIn the short to medium turn, you might see some online games or simplistic MMOs run with blockchain tech. If this happens, the closest project to make that happen might be Theta. It's decentralized, and it doesn't only handle bandwidth, but they've already successfully tried out handling processing. So imagine an MMO that doesn't rely on centralized servers, but instead on mass network of gamers, handling both bandwidth and processing of the game. Unlike Axie, blockchain would be more on the backend, and hidden. But in theory it should work.",0

It's like when you leave your money at the bank, they have the control of the money and they can refuse to let you withdraw if they wish.\n\nHaving a wallet like metamask, trust wallet, token pocket etc, is just like having the money in your pocket, you have control of it.\n\nBoth have its advantages and disadvantages, it is way easier for you to get hacked with a personal wallet (if you get a virus or do something stupid online) then with a exchange account.\n\nBut as I said previously exchanges control your cash and they can simply refuse to send you your funds if they suspect you are doing anything illegal or against their interest.\n\nI myself hold most of my funds on a hardware wallet, I also have some other online wallets and leave very few on exchanges. Most of the cash I leave in exchanges are to avoid paying high fees.",0

(you are god). based on that it is safer to say ""i invest in the top x coins"" instead of saying i only invest in coin x and coin y.\n2. investing in altcoins in addition to btc can increase your roi considerably. investing in top 7-10 coins tends to yield the most return in this case study (x3).\n3. based on #2, a crypto etf (or a similar service from exchanges that allow us to buy in bulk) could give exposure to the top x coins while saving transaction costs considerably.\n\nif you want more details, here is what your wallet would look like in each case of the above:\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ note:** this whole case study was a fun project and i was trying to answer some questions and thought to share it with you in case that would help you in any way. also it is important to not that history does not dictate the future, so please take all of what i present here with a grain of salt.\n\nmuch love!

"Update on the market after the Luna CrashHey Guys! I want to update with you on my thoughts on the Crypto market and the recent crashes and also to warn you of few potential dangers. I wanted to post this a couple of days back, but since I was packed up and had limited knowledge on the situation, I waited till I did proper research on this. \n\n**Why did Terra-Money Crash?**\n\nTerra-Money is a stable coin project launched by Do Kwon, it's main objective was to make a truly decentralized Stablecoin (UST) which is not backed by fiat or any other centralised asset, So the LUNA token was born to peg the UST to make sure the UST is stable. Needless to say, even a child can see how weak and volatile that is going to be. It was never really a strong project to begin with regardless of the attacks. \n\n**Will Terra-Money Recover?**\n\nI know its been tough, to hold through this and bleed your money. The network has been halted, Do kwon accepted a community idea of recovering the stable coin which Do Kwon accepted but its highly unlikely that UST will be stable any time soon. the future of LUNA is even dimmer, With the most optimistic thought, I'd say both might survive, But UST won't be a stablecoin and LUNA won't recover for at least a couple of years. \n\n**What does it mean for the rest of the Stablecoins?**\n\nThis just shows, how fragile the market is and to what extent whales can manipulate the price, this was probably the biggest blow, in the history of Investment. However, this is a clear indication of War against Centralised and Decentralised Crypto. Central Banks, Investment firms will short and remove it  from existence if it directly threats them. If you are holding any other Decentralised Stable Coin or a coin which is backing the stablecoin. Watch out!\n\nsome examples are USDD and TRON Coin, DAI and MakerDao, USDN and Waves, and a bunch of other Stable coin which are backed by crypto are all at risk\n\nI am personally not worried for USDC or USDT crashing cause if they do its the end of all economy and Crypto as we know it. \n\n**What does it mean for the rest of the Crypto-Currencies?**\n\nA lot of people are asking/saying things like, this is the end of Crypto Currency, Prices will never recover, etc. These statements has no logic or reason behind them other than pure emotion. \n\nCrypto market will be up again, with or without LUNA. The Economy is at a Crisis, every currency (fiat and crypto) are falling so its natural for other cryptos to be down. Also this Luna crash might have added salt to injury. But there's no point is staying away from them, when they are backed by Literal Countries and a lot of Whales. \n\nBe careful, even though the market will recover, some of the coins will weak fundamentals might never recover. so please focus on the fundamentals and the people behind the project before investing."," World First USE -2- EARN Ecosystem. \n\n= Alpha App Live\n\n=ò Platinum Badge on GEMPAD\n=ò No Private Sale\n=ò Contract Verified \n=ò Audit Passed By ContractWolf\n=ò KYC'd By GEMPAD\n=ò Partnership With Coinhunt,    NABOX, IKONIC.\n\n=Ó Presale Start Time 05-06-2022 on GEMPAD\n\n=ò @useonbsc",0

"when transferring coins between exchanges, use xlm to be able to move around with virtually no fees! just started doing this recently and realised i couldve saved myself hundreds in fees if i had begun to do this earlier. its especially great if youre constantly moving around smaller amounts between exchanges and youre a frequent buyer of smaller cap coins from exchanges like kucoin like me. ill list the fees/withdrawal limits to give everyone a practical idea of how it works\n\nminimum binance withdrawal for btc is currently 0.001 which is ~40. every transacation comes at a cost of 0.0005 btc which is ~20/$28, meaning if youre looking to withdraw around 200/$280 youre already around 10% down. over time if youre frequently looking to buy smaller coins not listed on major, this really starts to add up.\n\nsimilarly with eth, minimum withdrawal amount is 0.016 which is ~45/$63 with a fee of 0.005 on every transaction which is around 15/$21 every transaction, looking to withdraw 200/$280 there and youre down around 8%.\n\nlooking at xlm, minimum withdrawal amount is 40 which is ~16/$22 at current prices. a what really stands out though is the transaction fee, youre looking at an 0.02 fee every time which is less than 0.01! \n\nthe great thing about xlm is that its also available on the vast majority of exchanges, so converting it back after is super easy. there are other coins which work with the tiny fees, but in terms of availability they arent always listed across exchanges so xlm is the perfect middle ground.","Been using XRP recently too, specially from uphold",0
"what is the next big idea (game changer) in crypto? what kind of revolutionary ideas would alter the crypto world as we currently see it? cryptocurrency is amazing, but what could we do to improve it? if a coin came along and was able to implement an idea that made crypto faster, more intuitive, more secure, etc, imagine the excitement of being a part of the next evolution of crypto blockchain devolvement. or, what if you had a badass idea and someone on this sub came along and said, ""hey man! your idea has already been done and you need to invest in xyz coin today fool so they can implement it quick!"" oh the joy!\n\ni have read quite a few innovative ideas on this sub and have conjured up a few of my own ideas as well. i imagine some of the things that we would like to see are just not compatible with blockchain mechanics, but i am limited to my ignorance on the matter, so you be prepared to see some wild and improbable speculation.\n\ni'll go first. it is all hypothetical and for fun:\n\n**crypto limbo**\n*problem*: holy shit i just lost 1 eth because i sent it to the wrong address. it is gone. essentially, you burned it and there is no going back. or, even worse... you have a malicious virus on your device that changes your pasted addresses to a hacker is address.\n\n*solution?:* 2 authys and a happy ending.\n\n our hypothetical coin will be called confirmation exchange token (cet). before any transaction made on the blockchain exchanges is finalized you receive a deposit of a single cet token that has a contract to authenticate and verify a successful target address. \n\n*example*: let is say you want to send 1 eth to pay for new tires on your lambo. you send it to your exchange account on kraken. before you receive the eth, you get a notification from kraken that one cet coin has deposited. by design and some magic dev engineering, it triggers an authentication request on the kraken exchange for your authy app code (or any other authenticator like google auth, etc). after you type in your authy code for kraken, you then go back to your original account which prompts it is own authentication request, this completes the send, and your ethereum is now in it is correct and verified new home. \n\n*failsafe*: this process requires 2 authentications. if it was not sent to the right address, both authy codes never prompt you from either account and the transaction times out and does not process. \n\nhere is another one....................................\n\n**not your keys**\n*problem*: i want to have the benefit of using an exchange 24/7, being able to trade, swap, sell, buy, future, short, watch it dip and rise in real-time, etc and own the keys to each and every individual coin right up until i sell them. \n\n*solution*?: contracts with ownership. the keys to your coins are tied to a contract that transfers ownership with every transaction that trades hands (sells, swap, etc). \n\nwatchya think? got a better solution speaking from dev experience? please, please, share!\n\nanyway, tell me your ideas or your solutions to some of these problems. let is brainstorm and inspire!",Imagine hardware wallets in phones,0

how to invest in undiscovered but valid crypto that will explode in the future? i'm fairly new to the crypto world and i understand that one of the basic ways to generate good return on crypto is to look for cryptos on coin market cap that have very low market capitalisation (10 million - 100 million range) and available at a low price as well and then research those cryptos and see which ones have the potential to become something huge.\n\nnow obviously most of these low market cap cryptos would not be on big exchanges like binance. i'm not considering coinbase since i'm not from the us.\n\nso how do i invest in them since most crypto exchanges are based in some foreign country and i don't know how to transfer my money without spending on transfer cost and other international transaction cost that might incur?,Open your vault!

"when transferring coins between exchanges, use xlm to be able to move around with virtually no fees! just started doing this recently and realised i couldve saved myself hundreds in fees if i had begun to do this earlier. its especially great if youre constantly moving around smaller amounts between exchanges and youre a frequent buyer of smaller cap coins from exchanges like kucoin like me. ill list the fees/withdrawal limits to give everyone a practical idea of how it works\n\nminimum binance withdrawal for btc is currently 0.001 which is ~40. every transacation comes at a cost of 0.0005 btc which is ~20/$28, meaning if youre looking to withdraw around 200/$280 youre already around 10% down. over time if youre frequently looking to buy smaller coins not listed on major, this really starts to add up.\n\nsimilarly with eth, minimum withdrawal amount is 0.016 which is ~45/$63 with a fee of 0.005 on every transaction which is around 15/$21 every transaction, looking to withdraw 200/$280 there and youre down around 8%.\n\nlooking at xlm, minimum withdrawal amount is 40 which is ~16/$22 at current prices. a what really stands out though is the transaction fee, youre looking at an 0.02 fee every time which is less than 0.01! \n\nthe great thing about xlm is that its also available on the vast majority of exchanges, so converting it back after is super easy. there are other coins which work with the tiny fees, but in terms of availability they arent always listed across exchanges so xlm is the perfect middle ground.",They are basically one of the OGs of Cryptocurrencies too so that makes sense.,0

"Scammed yesterday, need help getting support from Cybercrime Division.hello people, just before Ethereum Merge, there were many scams running and I fell for one. I am a dickhead and thought that I was immune to such bullshit. In my case the guy was impersonating Vitalik - founder of Ethereum. He posted a fake giveaway on Twitter id u/Zidwait saying that he will give 2x Ethereum back to people who deposit ETH in his wallet. This was also the top result in Google Search as well for the whole day. \n\nHe had linked a site - [www.ethereum-celebration.com](https://www.ethereum-celebration.com) where he had shared his wallet address - **0x346b289363a057387d0d6b8b568abfbc82a8b0a6** where ETH had to be deposited. I deposited around 0.428 ETH and obviously didn't get anything back as I had fallen for a scam foolishly. \n\nI instantly reported this to Binance customer support, and they told me that they could only help me if the scammer had his wallet with Binance only, otherwise they couldn't do anything and told me to report to local law enforcement. I have already made a detailed report on [cybercrime.gov.in](https://cybercrime.gov.in) website portal with screenshots and all but I haven't got any response. I even tried to call their helpline number today, but no one picked the call. \n\nNow I did my own research the whole day and was able to track the scammer's transactions to a Binance wallet which I reported to Binance few hours back. They have told me that they have frozen his account, but **they cannot block it permanently and they need a request from a law enforcement to block his account** and get my money back. I provided them with below proof - \n\nthis is the wallet (#1) address they were using to get eth deposited - [https://etherscan.io/address/0x346b289363a057387d0d6b8b568abfbc82a8b0a6](https://etherscan.io/address/0x346b289363a057387d0d6b8b568abfbc82a8b0a6) . Check the 2nd and 3rd transactions to their new Wallet (#2) - **0xd1b7cca582578bff37faab547a4d50ff6342c6d0**. He obviously reroutes the stolen ETH across various wallets. Now see this transaction from wallet #2 to another new wallet (#3) - **0xFAA9C6676473D049FAe82D8277d1f53028FF76Ae**. Then, as can be seen @ [https://etherscan.io/address/0xfaa9c6676473d049fae82d8277d1f53028ff76ae](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfaa9c6676473d049fae82d8277d1f53028ff76ae) , he transfers all the stolen ETH from wallet #3 into his Binance wallet. As you can see this wallet is only used to transfer funds into Binance. There are no other outgoing transactions. \n\nFor anyone still not convinced, follow a few transactions at this link -  [Address 0xab6db7eb524e2d06c5209e21e68ba02dc501f912 | Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xab6db7eb524e2d06c5209e21e68ba02dc501f912) \n\nI have some other proofs for his other wallets as well, but this was the easiest to explain. From his other wallets that I saw, this person seems to have scammed to tune of almost hundreds of thousands of dollars. This is what Binance is seeking -  \n\n'*An official Law Enforcement request raised by a police officer through the following link* [*https://www.binance.com/en/support/law-enforcement*](https://www.binance.com/en/support/law-enforcement) *from an official email address and attaching the following:*\n\n*A.

After researching the shit out of everything and talking with Binance support till late evening, I went to local cybercrime cell (*which I was not even sure if it existed in first place. I live in a Tier 3 city*) and they told me to go to State Cyber cell tomorrow morning. But from their google reviews I am pretty sure I won't get much help there either.

I love a lot of Defi projects, as I see that becoming a massive (if not the biggest) overall crypto project (as a whole, decentralized finance). ETH, Chainlink, The Graph, Uniswap, Maker, Aave, all will play an important role in the ecosystem. Also projects that will help facilitate real world financial transactions like XLM that have real world adoption and lots of backing/partners. There's plenty of great projects to ""invest"" in, but 90% of coins out will be worth less than what they are now in 10yrs so it's best to do some digging before throwing money into something you don't understand.",0

"can somebody help me understand why crypto is a hedge against inflation? i understand that if the value of fiat goes down, then your fiat is worth less in terms of purchasing power ($1 used to be able to buy x, but now it takes $2 to buy x). but if you have to convert crypto to fiat to utilize its purchasing potential, then isnt it essentially subject to the same inflation depreciation? i guess when you can start purchasing things with crypto it takes the fiat middle man out and they are not tied together, but i still feel like people will be thinking in terms of fiat equivalency. for example, you want to pay for something that would cost 100 crypto, wouldnt the person selling know how much that crypto would equal in fiat and want to make sure they are appropriately pricing it? and if so, wouldnt they then take fiat inflation into account? ive never paid for anything using cryptocurrency so i dont really know how it flies down logistically. does the cost of the food or service continually fluctuate with price fluctuations in the crypto? really appreciate any insight","Exactly.

There are TONS of rules, but they are constantly broken. It's clever if you think about it. If there is no rule, you can't punish someone. If there is a rule and someone breaks it, you have the choice to look the other way or move forward with punishment.\n\nI believe that a lot of the authoritarian vibe here is kind of a charade. If the people THINK that everything is monitored ultra closely, and that penalties are looming, most people will back away. But I don't think they've got that great a handle on things. That said, being thrown in jail for something ridiculous, or something you didn't even do, is always on the table.\n\nLastly, most Chinese people buy crypto on the black market. Paxful is popular and the rates are good. You can use WeChat or Alipay to transact, but I wouldn't personally feel comfortable doing it.",0
"if everyone is talking about it you're probably late. (not financial advice).\n\never heard the old phrase ' buy the rumour sell the news?

"what is the next big idea (game changer) in crypto? what kind of revolutionary ideas would alter the crypto world as we currently see it? cryptocurrency is amazing, but what could we do to improve it? if a coin came along and was able to implement an idea that made crypto faster, more intuitive, more secure, etc, imagine the excitement of being a part of the next evolution of crypto blockchain devolvement. or, what if you had a badass idea and someone on this sub came along and said, ""hey man! your idea has already been done and you need to invest in xyz coin today fool so they can implement it quick!"" oh the joy!\n\ni have read quite a few innovative ideas on this sub and have conjured up a few of my own ideas as well. i imagine some of the things that we would like to see are just not compatible with blockchain mechanics, but i am limited to my ignorance on the matter, so you be prepared to see some wild and improbable speculation.\n\ni'll go first. it is all hypothetical and for fun:\n\n**crypto limbo**\n*problem*: holy shit i just lost 1 eth because i sent it to the wrong address. it is gone. essentially, you burned it and there is no going back. or, even worse... you have a malicious virus on your device that changes your pasted addresses to a hacker is address.\n\n*solution?:* 2 authys and a happy ending.\n\n our hypothetical coin will be called confirmation exchange token (cet). before any transaction made on the blockchain exchanges is finalized you receive a deposit of a single cet token that has a contract to authenticate and verify a successful target address. \n\n*example*: let is say you want to send 1 eth to pay for new tires on your lambo. you send it to your exchange account on kraken. before you receive the eth, you get a notification from kraken that one cet coin has deposited. by design and some magic dev engineering, it triggers an authentication request on the kraken exchange for your authy app code (or any other authenticator like google auth, etc). after you type in your authy code for kraken, you then go back to your original account which prompts it is own authentication request, this completes the send, and your ethereum is now in it is correct and verified new home. \n\n*failsafe*: this process requires 2 authentications. if it was not sent to the right address, both authy codes never prompt you from either account and the transaction times out and does not process. \n\nhere is another one....................................\n\n**not your keys**\n*problem*: i want to have the benefit of using an exchange 24/7, being able to trade, swap, sell, buy, future, short, watch it dip and rise in real-time, etc and own the keys to each and every individual coin right up until i sell them. \n\n*solution*?: contracts with ownership. the keys to your coins are tied to a contract that transfers ownership with every transaction that trades hands (sells, swap, etc). \n\nwatchya think? got a better solution speaking from dev experience? please, please, share!\n\nanyway, tell me your ideas or your solutions to some of these problems. let is brainstorm and inspire!",1 bitcoin in circulation...,0

Do I have to pay 30% crypto tax in this scenario?Suppose I have a portfolio of 100k USD in ethereum and I want to convert 10k USD to fiat. So I go on AAVE and put 30k as collateral and get 10k in any stable coin like USDT. After that I sell that USDT in an exchange and repay back my crypto loan using 10k from my 70k portfolio and get back my collateral. I borrowed 10k in USDT and I sold it for fiat but it didn't have any capital gains.

"what is the other side of the coin in the ethereum fraud argument? hello everyone! \n\ni'm not a big tech savvy but i like to understand things as far as i can, i recently came across a subreddit called r/ethereumfraud (or something like this) but they are very closed and comments are completely controlled by the mods( which i find very strange) however i would like to understand the other side of their arguments. could you guys explain why ethereum is not a scam?","I dont know much about the claims about Ethereum being a fraud, but I assume they are talking about the choice to do a fork to undo transactions after a major DAO turned out to have a vulnerability in its code (this is the origin of Ethereum Classic which is a continuation of the original blockchain).\n\nThey use the as an argument to say that Ethereum isnt decentralized and that the code for smart contracts arent truly final. They think that code should be law, other people think that the intention behind the code should be law.\n\nThe argument against this is that the decision to roll back the Ethereum blockchain wasnt made by the founders/developers alone. ETH is decentralized and the only reason Ethereum won over Ethereum Classic is that they had consensus amongst the community, users, miners and developers. Without the support of the community Ethereum wouldnt have been able to do this rollback.\n\nPeople love saying that Ethereum isnt decentralized, and it is true that some people have more influence than ithers, but in my opinion Ethereum is still very much decentralized. If the founders tried to for example implemented a fee per transaction going to them/developers or something ridiculous like that it would never work because the community, users and miners would never accept it.",1

(you are god). based on that it is safer to say ""i invest in the top x coins"" instead of saying i only invest in coin x and coin y.\n2. investing in altcoins in addition to btc can increase your roi considerably. investing in top 7-10 coins tends to yield the most return in this case study (x3).\n3. based on #2, a crypto etf (or a similar service from exchanges that allow us to buy in bulk) could give exposure to the top x coins while saving transaction costs considerably.\n\nif you want more details, here is what your wallet would look like in each case of the above:\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ note:** this whole case study was a fun project and i was trying to answer some questions and thought to share it with you in case that would help you in any way. also it is important to not that history does not dictate the future, so please take all of what i present here with a grain of salt.\n\nmuch love!

"social skills 101 for crypto bros saw a question on askmen subreddit ""what is the male version of astrology girl?"" and to no one is surprise crypto dude is one of the top answers.\n\nlet is be real here, we people who are into crypto have a bad reputation socially. we are at best socially inept, at worst cult-like. the stereotype of the crypto bros is one who tries to 'teach' them about crypto, and get them to convert their hard earned money to the sacred crypto. i have been on dates and the moment i talk about crypto, i can literal feel her pants tighten up, and help her remember that she has something important came up and need to end the date early.\n\nto help with dispelling this negative image of crypto bros, i decided to write up this post on how to improve our social skills with people.\n\nthe fundamental issue with crypto bros is basing his entire identity around crypto itself. to be fair, basing one is identity to a single thing, like religion, politics, work etc. is a horrible idea. life is a lot more than just crypto; have some fun hobbies, be proactive in your professional career, be involved in friends and families' lives. i get that you're passionate about crypto and how it will change your life, that doesn't mean you have to shove it down into other people is throat. it is like that annoying christian dude that won't shut up about jesus and somehow connecting every conversational topic to him.\n\ni am not advocating for people to actively hide the fact that they're into crypto, if it comes out in a conversation, it comes out. there is a huge difference in responding to the question ""what are you into?"" with ""i'm really into my job (or ""working towards my dream job"" if you hate your job), i'm into (some hobby), and like to trade some crypto on the side."" vs ""oh i'm really into crypto!"" followed by a 1 hour lecture on crypto. what i'm saying is that it is important to be a well-rounded person and not basing your entire identity on crypto alone.\n\nan unhealthy mentality crypto bros have is what i call the 'red pill' mentality, where they feel superior just because they're into crypto and the person they're talking to isn't. this same mentality is also commonly found in cults, conspiracy nuts and anti-vaxxers.\n\nanother important thing, read their body language. if when talking about crypto and you can see they're no longer attentive like looking away or just looking dead in the eye, change the topic. this applies to any conversational topic. if they're not into what you're into, that is ok. if they're interested in crypto, naturally they'll ask you more about it.\n\nremember a social interaction is a two-way street, where you share about what you're into, they share theirs, and establishing commonalities. it is not you shoving down your isuperior' crypto ways into their throats.",You guys are going on dates?,0

"when transferring coins between exchanges, use xlm to be able to move around with virtually no fees! just started doing this recently and realised i couldve saved myself hundreds in fees if i had begun to do this earlier. its especially great if youre constantly moving around smaller amounts between exchanges and youre a frequent buyer of smaller cap coins from exchanges like kucoin like me. ill list the fees/withdrawal limits to give everyone a practical idea of how it works\n\nminimum binance withdrawal for btc is currently 0.001 which is ~40. every transacation comes at a cost of 0.0005 btc which is ~20/$28, meaning if youre looking to withdraw around 200/$280 youre already around 10% down. over time if youre frequently looking to buy smaller coins not listed on major, this really starts to add up.\n\nsimilarly with eth, minimum withdrawal amount is 0.016 which is ~45/$63 with a fee of 0.005 on every transaction which is around 15/$21 every transaction, looking to withdraw 200/$280 there and youre down around 8%.\n\nlooking at xlm, minimum withdrawal amount is 40 which is ~16/$22 at current prices. a what really stands out though is the transaction fee, youre looking at an 0.02 fee every time which is less than 0.01! \n\nthe great thing about xlm is that its also available on the vast majority of exchanges, so converting it back after is super easy. there are other coins which work with the tiny fees, but in terms of availability they arent always listed across exchanges so xlm is the perfect middle ground.","Use Harmony ONE, its 2 second transaction time and 0.001 fees.",0

"dumb question. i am relatively new to crypto. should we exit before minor correction (10-25%) by taking profit and busying in dip or staking at 25% and riding correction. imagine, i have invested 15000$ and made it to 20000$ in a crypto which now is trading at 0.04$ that gives you roughly 500,000 coins. now, if i think markets are in correction mode and the crypto might go down to 0.02-0.03$ which gives me anywhere between 10-15k investment left. \nquestions\n1) would exiting now by paying some % selling fee on exchange and later some % buying fee equal to profit made on buying same coin at 25-50% correction later. \nexample: \nexit now 20,000$ by selling at 0.04\nbut later 0.03 * 20000$ = 688,333 coins. \nhere catch is 20000$ would be close to 19500 may be after % fee in buying and selling so that leaves us with 0.03*19500 = 650,000 \n\nis this worth it???? or stake same coin at 25% and ride the lows.\n\nthanks","25% would work for me, but its honestly what ever you are comfortable with.",1

"is bitcoin is value solely based on the greater fool theory? disclaimer: i actually hold btc myself as an investment, but i'm really wondering what intrinsic value and use case bitcoin has.\njust to clarify, i do understand most of the technical details of bitcoin like mining, proof of work and the 21 million cap. \nthe greater fool theory is basically the idea that the price of an asset is determined by how much others are willing to pay for it. basically people buy something because they can sell it for more to a greater fool, who then hopes they can sell it to an even greater fool thus leading to the price continuing to grow as more and more people buy in. i'm sure we've all seen the likes of r/technology calling this ponzi/pyramid/mlm which isn't exactly what it is, but the idea is the same. \ni'm playing devil is advocate here, but what really sets btc apart from speculative bubbles like dutch tulips or beanie babies? as in why would you buy bitcoin other than hoping to sell it for more later? it was originally intended to be electronic cash but it obviously didn't go that route. \nif you say it is a store of value (which i understand why) it doesn't seem to hold stable value as of present, like precious metals do. will the price stabilise in the future or do we just hope it will?\nif you say the lack of barriers to easily transfer value anywhere in the world, there is plenty of much more efficient blockchain technologies that do it much better than btc.\nif you say decentralisation, that is not what the majority are buying btc for. they (including many of us) just want to make money. how much intrinsic value does it really provide?\njust to reiterate, i'm not against bitcoin. i am just wondering if anyone has some convincing counterarguments to these criticisms and a lot of others, instead of just saying the people who make these arguments are ignorant or uneducated (though some may be).\nif you have any other criticisms of btc feel free to share, and i would love to hear some rebuttals to other common claims made by the likes of r/technology.",Funny you say that.

"whats your relationship with bitcoin? bitcoin. the granddaddy of crypto sure evokes a reaction in all of us. some of us despise it, thinking that its overrated much like the emperor who thinks hes flaunting his new clothes but is actually naked. some dont mind it but prefer to bank on eth soaring high. \n\nothers believe so fervently in it that they consistently swap the profits they gain from altcoins to btc. yet others take a balanced approach as they keep an equal proportion of btc and eth. \n\nwhich of the above mentioned camps do you fall into? are you initially a btc maxi but decided to diversify your portfolio and spread your love? or did you find yourself getting burnt by altcoins and embracing btc more and more?","It's a very toxic relationship, and the sex is painful.

"which is better: buying top coins vs. buying btc &amp; eth - (a 6 years dca case study) inspired by [this post]( i built a script to analyse if you dca'd blindly in the top crypto coins vs. investing in btc &amp; eth vs investing only in btc since the beginning of 2015, how much would your total worth is. here are the results.\n\n**numbers &amp; assumptions:**\n\n* dcaing takes place every week, on 1st, 8th, 15th and 22th of every month starting from jan 1st 2015 and until july 6th 2021.\n* investments budget per week is $100.\n* the weekly investment is divided equally on the coins invested in.\n* this case study is ignoring stable coin investments. e.g.: investing in the top 5 coins means the top 5 coins excluding any stable coins.\n* the analysis is assuming that you invested your money and never sold any coin till now.\n* total invested money over the whole dca period is $31,300.\n* transaction fees are not included in the analysis.\n\n**here are the results:**\n\n* if you blindly dca into the top 1 coins (btc), you will end up with **$1,102,104**.\n* if you blindly dca into the top 2 coins, you will end up with 4 coins (btc, xrp, ltc, eth) in your wallet and total worth of **$1,462,443**.\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 3 coins**, you will end up with 11 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,310,552.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 5 coins**, you will end up with 23 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,490,189.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 7 coins**, you will end up with 37 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,923,849.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 10 coins**, you will end up with 55 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,316,169.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 20 coins**, you will end up with 130 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,619,756.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 50 coins**, you will end up with 381 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$979,086.**\n* if you had a glass ball and knew that eth will be what it is today and you invested only in btc &amp; eth, you will end up with 2 coins in your wallet (surprise), and a total worth of **$4,505,477.**\n\n**some observations:**\n\n1. although it was relatively easier to guess that btc will be the #1 crypto coin back then, nobody would have guessed for sure that eth will be #2, so betting on btc &amp; eth only from the beginning would've been your strategy only if you know the future.

"can somebody help me understand why crypto is a hedge against inflation? i understand that if the value of fiat goes down, then your fiat is worth less in terms of purchasing power ($1 used to be able to buy x, but now it takes $2 to buy x). but if you have to convert crypto to fiat to utilize its purchasing potential, then isnt it essentially subject to the same inflation depreciation? i guess when you can start purchasing things with crypto it takes the fiat middle man out and they are not tied together, but i still feel like people will be thinking in terms of fiat equivalency. for example, you want to pay for something that would cost 100 crypto, wouldnt the person selling know how much that crypto would equal in fiat and want to make sure they are appropriately pricing it? and if so, wouldnt they then take fiat inflation into account? ive never paid for anything using cryptocurrency so i dont really know how it flies down logistically. does the cost of the food or service continually fluctuate with price fluctuations in the crypto? really appreciate any insight",Thats a interesting idea&start selling ancient frozen turkeys:D,0

"would a trustless raffle be possible using cryptocurrency? hi. my friends have been raffling objects they made and donating the pooled money to charity. the way it works is people send them usd using venmo or paypal and then whoever set up the raffle donates that money that is being pooled to a charity. the issue is that to donate you have to trust that they won't pocket the money. this trust system limits who are comfortable participating in the raffle, in a sense the raffle can't expand beyond a close network of known people. would there be a way to set up a crypto wallet that people can send crypto to that can be audited by everyone? it would also be interesting if the wallet would automatically send the money to charity at a set date. in essence, a system that is programmed to pool the money, securely and transparently, and then send it to a charity without needing human input. \n\nthe potential resistance to using cryptocurrency for this is that i suspect most people participating in the raffles do not have much crypto experience. there are also transaction fees to consider as well as the issue of potentially having to convert the crypto to usd before donating it. it would be extra cool if the wallet can pick a raffle winner as well! using a stablecoin pegged to usd might be the way to go for this. if anybody has any ideas or suggestions i would appreciate it!","Hello, your post was removed because your account is less than 60 days old or you do not have the required 500 **comment** karma to make post submissions.",1

"when transferring coins between exchanges, use xlm to be able to move around with virtually no fees! just started doing this recently and realised i couldve saved myself hundreds in fees if i had begun to do this earlier. its especially great if youre constantly moving around smaller amounts between exchanges and youre a frequent buyer of smaller cap coins from exchanges like kucoin like me. ill list the fees/withdrawal limits to give everyone a practical idea of how it works\n\nminimum binance withdrawal for btc is currently 0.001 which is ~40. every transacation comes at a cost of 0.0005 btc which is ~20/$28, meaning if youre looking to withdraw around 200/$280 youre already around 10% down. over time if youre frequently looking to buy smaller coins not listed on major, this really starts to add up.\n\nsimilarly with eth, minimum withdrawal amount is 0.016 which is ~45/$63 with a fee of 0.005 on every transaction which is around 15/$21 every transaction, looking to withdraw 200/$280 there and youre down around 8%.\n\nlooking at xlm, minimum withdrawal amount is 40 which is ~16/$22 at current prices. a what really stands out though is the transaction fee, youre looking at an 0.02 fee every time which is less than 0.01! \n\nthe great thing about xlm is that its also available on the vast majority of exchanges, so converting it back after is super easy. there are other coins which work with the tiny fees, but in terms of availability they arent always listed across exchanges so xlm is the perfect middle ground.",Don't worry i had to deal with them a few times and they will fix this :),0

Every wallet and dapp depends upon this central server.\n\n\nThis isn't true today. Initially, CryptoKitties made the decision to depend completely on MetaMask, and funnel everybody through the MetaMask browser to use the dApp, and all of that traffic goes through Infura nodes on the backend. That was a different era in Ethereum's development altogether. \n\n>According to Vitalik and ethereum foundation, average users should not be running full nodes. Apparently there are average and special users in ethereum. Read the tweet below\n\n\nAlso wrong. Not validating the entire blockchain history /= not running a full node. Lookup stateless clients and stateless Ethereum. The primary aim of Stateless Ethereum is to make Ethereum scale, by mitigating unbounded state growth. That still means running a full node.\n\n\n\n\n>Bitcoin actively encourages average users to run nodes and the reason Bitcoin innovations are so deliberate and painstakingly developed is because there is zero compromise on this principle.\n\n\nThere's no financial gain in running my own light node. So I don't care. Just because Bitcoin hobbyists are running nodes or are running lightening network now doesn't make it profitable and sustainable in the long term, at all.

It's purely speculative on the idea of it actually being profitable from microtransactions in the future, however it's currently not.\n\n\n>Bitcoin was built expecting the government to attack it. To this day it's part of Bitcoin development ethos that government actions should be irrelevant. \n\n\nThen why is so difficult for bitcoin miners to move if they were to be shut down? If I'm a goverment and I want to force miners to comply,  I can easily find miners based on how much energy they use. Under proof of stake, that becomes a lot more difficult. And if they do find me, I can quickly shut down my node and set up somewhere else without moving any equipment. You can't say the same about Bitcoin mining. Bitcoin miners have less room to ignore compliance and have to play nice with governments, especially when states like Texas are literally subsidizing miners.

(you are god). based on that it is safer to say ""i invest in the top x coins"" instead of saying i only invest in coin x and coin y.\n2. investing in altcoins in addition to btc can increase your roi considerably. investing in top 7-10 coins tends to yield the most return in this case study (x3).\n3. based on #2, a crypto etf (or a similar service from exchanges that allow us to buy in bulk) could give exposure to the top x coins while saving transaction costs considerably.\n\nif you want more details, here is what your wallet would look like in each case of the above:\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ note:** this whole case study was a fun project and i was trying to answer some questions and thought to share it with you in case that would help you in any way. also it is important to not that history does not dictate the future, so please take all of what i present here with a grain of salt.\n\nmuch love!

XLM is preferred because it's fast and accepted everywhere\n\n2) IMO no.  DYOR can basically be any research - like this post.

"which is better: buying top coins vs. buying btc &amp; eth - (a 6 years dca case study) inspired by [this post]( i built a script to analyse if you dca'd blindly in the top crypto coins vs. investing in btc &amp; eth vs investing only in btc since the beginning of 2015, how much would your total worth is. here are the results.\n\n**numbers &amp; assumptions:**\n\n* dcaing takes place every week, on 1st, 8th, 15th and 22th of every month starting from jan 1st 2015 and until july 6th 2021.\n* investments budget per week is $100.\n* the weekly investment is divided equally on the coins invested in.\n* this case study is ignoring stable coin investments. e.g.: investing in the top 5 coins means the top 5 coins excluding any stable coins.\n* the analysis is assuming that you invested your money and never sold any coin till now.\n* total invested money over the whole dca period is $31,300.\n* transaction fees are not included in the analysis.\n\n**here are the results:**\n\n* if you blindly dca into the top 1 coins (btc), you will end up with **$1,102,104**.\n* if you blindly dca into the top 2 coins, you will end up with 4 coins (btc, xrp, ltc, eth) in your wallet and total worth of **$1,462,443**.\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 3 coins**, you will end up with 11 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,310,552.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 5 coins**, you will end up with 23 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,490,189.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 7 coins**, you will end up with 37 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,923,849.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 10 coins**, you will end up with 55 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,316,169.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 20 coins**, you will end up with 130 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,619,756.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 50 coins**, you will end up with 381 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$979,086.**\n* if you had a glass ball and knew that eth will be what it is today and you invested only in btc &amp; eth, you will end up with 2 coins in your wallet (surprise), and a total worth of **$4,505,477.**\n\n**some observations:**\n\n1. although it was relatively easier to guess that btc will be the #1 crypto coin back then, nobody would have guessed for sure that eth will be #2, so betting on btc &amp; eth only from the beginning would've been your strategy only if you know the future.

What is play to earn games in crypto?,"""Play-to-earn is a new business model where real money can be earned by playing video games centered on cryptocurrency-based assets, known as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). By actively participating in these virtual economies, players can earn rewards such as in-game assets and tokens, which can then be traded or sold on an open market if the player chooses to do so. This represents an important shift in the gaming world because, traditionally, in-game assets were confined to centralized protocols.   \nThere are many play-to-earn games like splinterlands, axile infinity, and many more.

"which is better: buying top coins vs. buying btc &amp; eth - (a 6 years dca case study) inspired by [this post]( i built a script to analyse if you dca'd blindly in the top crypto coins vs. investing in btc &amp; eth vs investing only in btc since the beginning of 2015, how much would your total worth is. here are the results.\n\n**numbers &amp; assumptions:**\n\n* dcaing takes place every week, on 1st, 8th, 15th and 22th of every month starting from jan 1st 2015 and until july 6th 2021.\n* investments budget per week is $100.\n* the weekly investment is divided equally on the coins invested in.\n* this case study is ignoring stable coin investments. e.g.: investing in the top 5 coins means the top 5 coins excluding any stable coins.\n* the analysis is assuming that you invested your money and never sold any coin till now.\n* total invested money over the whole dca period is $31,300.\n* transaction fees are not included in the analysis.\n\n**here are the results:**\n\n* if you blindly dca into the top 1 coins (btc), you will end up with **$1,102,104**.\n* if you blindly dca into the top 2 coins, you will end up with 4 coins (btc, xrp, ltc, eth) in your wallet and total worth of **$1,462,443**.\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 3 coins**, you will end up with 11 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,310,552.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 5 coins**, you will end up with 23 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,490,189.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 7 coins**, you will end up with 37 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,923,849.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 10 coins**, you will end up with 55 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,316,169.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 20 coins**, you will end up with 130 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,619,756.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 50 coins**, you will end up with 381 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$979,086.**\n* if you had a glass ball and knew that eth will be what it is today and you invested only in btc &amp; eth, you will end up with 2 coins in your wallet (surprise), and a total worth of **$4,505,477.**\n\n**some observations:**\n\n1. although it was relatively easier to guess that btc will be the #1 crypto coin back then, nobody would have guessed for sure that eth will be #2, so betting on btc &amp; eth only from the beginning would've been your strategy only if you know the future. (you are god). based on that it is safer to say ""i invest in the top x coins"" instead of saying i only invest in coin x and coin y.\n2. investing in altcoins in addition to btc can increase your roi considerably. investing in top 7-10 coins tends to yield the most return in this case study (x3).\n3. based on #2, a crypto etf (or a similar service from exchanges that allow us to buy in bulk) could give exposure to the top x coins while saving transaction costs considerably.\n\nif you want more details, here is what your wallet would look like in each case of the above:\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ note:** this whole case study was a fun project and i was trying to answer some questions and thought to share it with you in case that would help you in any way. also it is important to not that history does not dictate the future, so please take all of what i present here with a grain of salt.\n\nmuch love!

"social skills 101 for crypto bros saw a question on askmen subreddit ""what is the male version of astrology girl?"" and to no one is surprise crypto dude is one of the top answers.\n\nlet is be real here, we people who are into crypto have a bad reputation socially. we are at best socially inept, at worst cult-like. the stereotype of the crypto bros is one who tries to 'teach' them about crypto, and get them to convert their hard earned money to the sacred crypto. i have been on dates and the moment i talk about crypto, i can literal feel her pants tighten up, and help her remember that she has something important came up and need to end the date early.\n\nto help with dispelling this negative image of crypto bros, i decided to write up this post on how to improve our social skills with people.\n\nthe fundamental issue with crypto bros is basing his entire identity around crypto itself. to be fair, basing one is identity to a single thing, like religion, politics, work etc. is a horrible idea. life is a lot more than just crypto; have some fun hobbies, be proactive in your professional career, be involved in friends and families' lives. i get that you're passionate about crypto and how it will change your life, that doesn't mean you have to shove it down into other people is throat. it is like that annoying christian dude that won't shut up about jesus and somehow connecting every conversational topic to him.\n\ni am not advocating for people to actively hide the fact that they're into crypto, if it comes out in a conversation, it comes out. there is a huge difference in responding to the question ""what are you into?"" with ""i'm really into my job (or ""working towards my dream job"" if you hate your job), i'm into (some hobby), and like to trade some crypto on the side."" vs ""oh i'm really into crypto!"" followed by a 1 hour lecture on crypto. what i'm saying is that it is important to be a well-rounded person and not basing your entire identity on crypto alone.\n\nan unhealthy mentality crypto bros have is what i call the 'red pill' mentality, where they feel superior just because they're into crypto and the person they're talking to isn't. this same mentality is also commonly found in cults, conspiracy nuts and anti-vaxxers.\n\nanother important thing, read their body language. if when talking about crypto and you can see they're no longer attentive like looking away or just looking dead in the eye, change the topic. this applies to any conversational topic. if they're not into what you're into, that is ok. if they're interested in crypto, naturally they'll ask you more about it.\n\nremember a social interaction is a two-way street, where you share about what you're into, they share theirs, and establishing commonalities. it is not you shoving down your isuperior' crypto ways into their throats.","So you got any hobby's, well i am a crypto trader. \n\nGirl:* rols with her eyes*",0

"Update on the market after the Luna CrashHey Guys! I want to update with you on my thoughts on the Crypto market and the recent crashes and also to warn you of few potential dangers. I wanted to post this a couple of days back, but since I was packed up and had limited knowledge on the situation, I waited till I did proper research on this. \n\n**Why did Terra-Money Crash?**\n\nTerra-Money is a stable coin project launched by Do Kwon, it's main objective was to make a truly decentralized Stablecoin (UST) which is not backed by fiat or any other centralised asset, So the LUNA token was born to peg the UST to make sure the UST is stable. Needless to say, even a child can see how weak and volatile that is going to be. It was never really a strong project to begin with regardless of the attacks. \n\n**Will Terra-Money Recover?**\n\nI know its been tough, to hold through this and bleed your money. The network has been halted, Do kwon accepted a community idea of recovering the stable coin which Do Kwon accepted but its highly unlikely that UST will be stable any time soon. the future of LUNA is even dimmer, With the most optimistic thought, I'd say both might survive, But UST won't be a stablecoin and LUNA won't recover for at least a couple of years. \n\n**What does it mean for the rest of the Stablecoins?**\n\nThis just shows, how fragile the market is and to what extent whales can manipulate the price, this was probably the biggest blow, in the history of Investment. However, this is a clear indication of War against Centralised and Decentralised Crypto. Central Banks, Investment firms will short and remove it  from existence if it directly threats them. If you are holding any other Decentralised Stable Coin or a coin which is backing the stablecoin. Watch out!\n\nsome examples are USDD and TRON Coin, DAI and MakerDao, USDN and Waves, and a bunch of other Stable coin which are backed by crypto are all at risk\n\nI am personally not worried for USDC or USDT crashing cause if they do its the end of all economy and Crypto as we know it. \n\n**What does it mean for the rest of the Crypto-Currencies?**\n\nA lot of people are asking/saying things like, this is the end of Crypto Currency, Prices will never recover, etc. These statements has no logic or reason behind them other than pure emotion. \n\nCrypto market will be up again, with or without LUNA. The Economy is at a Crisis, every currency (fiat and crypto) are falling so its natural for other cryptos to be down. Also this Luna crash might have added salt to injury. But there's no point is staying away from them, when they are backed by Literal Countries and a lot of Whales. \n\nBe careful, even though the market will recover, some of the coins will weak fundamentals might never recover. so please focus on the fundamentals and the people behind the project before investing.","Not really. I didn't expect the token to completely die when I commented that. I may pickup some, if they plan to revive but I honestly don't see it going back to the pre-crash level anytime soon.\n\nEdit,: risked it and bought some Luna yesterday. Made a profit of 2.5x in 1 day.",1

"when transferring coins between exchanges, use xlm to be able to move around with virtually no fees! just started doing this recently and realised i couldve saved myself hundreds in fees if i had begun to do this earlier. its especially great if youre constantly moving around smaller amounts between exchanges and youre a frequent buyer of smaller cap coins from exchanges like kucoin like me. ill list the fees/withdrawal limits to give everyone a practical idea of how it works\n\nminimum binance withdrawal for btc is currently 0.001 which is ~40. every transacation comes at a cost of 0.0005 btc which is ~20/$28, meaning if youre looking to withdraw around 200/$280 youre already around 10% down. over time if youre frequently looking to buy smaller coins not listed on major, this really starts to add up.\n\nsimilarly with eth, minimum withdrawal amount is 0.016 which is ~45/$63 with a fee of 0.005 on every transaction which is around 15/$21 every transaction, looking to withdraw 200/$280 there and youre down around 8%.\n\nlooking at xlm, minimum withdrawal amount is 40 which is ~16/$22 at current prices. a what really stands out though is the transaction fee, youre looking at an 0.02 fee every time which is less than 0.01! \n\nthe great thing about xlm is that its also available on the vast majority of exchanges, so converting it back after is super easy. there are other coins which work with the tiny fees, but in terms of availability they arent always listed across exchanges so xlm is the perfect middle ground.","I tried this the other night and my transfer took 20 hours lol.

"Scammed yesterday, need help getting support from Cybercrime Division.hello people, just before Ethereum Merge, there were many scams running and I fell for one. I am a dickhead and thought that I was immune to such bullshit. In my case the guy was impersonating Vitalik - founder of Ethereum. He posted a fake giveaway on Twitter id u/Zidwait saying that he will give 2x Ethereum back to people who deposit ETH in his wallet. This was also the top result in Google Search as well for the whole day. \n\nHe had linked a site - [www.ethereum-celebration.com](https://www.ethereum-celebration.com) where he had shared his wallet address - **0x346b289363a057387d0d6b8b568abfbc82a8b0a6** where ETH had to be deposited. I deposited around 0.428 ETH and obviously didn't get anything back as I had fallen for a scam foolishly. \n\nI instantly reported this to Binance customer support, and they told me that they could only help me if the scammer had his wallet with Binance only, otherwise they couldn't do anything and told me to report to local law enforcement. I have already made a detailed report on [cybercrime.gov.in](https://cybercrime.gov.in) website portal with screenshots and all but I haven't got any response. I even tried to call their helpline number today, but no one picked the call. \n\nNow I did my own research the whole day and was able to track the scammer's transactions to a Binance wallet which I reported to Binance few hours back. They have told me that they have frozen his account, but **they cannot block it permanently and they need a request from a law enforcement to block his account** and get my money back. I provided them with below proof - \n\nthis is the wallet (#1) address they were using to get eth deposited - [https://etherscan.io/address/0x346b289363a057387d0d6b8b568abfbc82a8b0a6](https://etherscan.io/address/0x346b289363a057387d0d6b8b568abfbc82a8b0a6) . Check the 2nd and 3rd transactions to their new Wallet (#2) - **0xd1b7cca582578bff37faab547a4d50ff6342c6d0**. He obviously reroutes the stolen ETH across various wallets. Now see this transaction from wallet #2 to another new wallet (#3) - **0xFAA9C6676473D049FAe82D8277d1f53028FF76Ae**. Then, as can be seen @ [https://etherscan.io/address/0xfaa9c6676473d049fae82d8277d1f53028ff76ae](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfaa9c6676473d049fae82d8277d1f53028ff76ae) , he transfers all the stolen ETH from wallet #3 into his Binance wallet. As you can see this wallet is only used to transfer funds into Binance. There are no other outgoing transactions. \n\nFor anyone still not convinced, follow a few transactions at this link -  [Address 0xab6db7eb524e2d06c5209e21e68ba02dc501f912 | Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xab6db7eb524e2d06c5209e21e68ba02dc501f912) \n\nI have some other proofs for his other wallets as well, but this was the easiest to explain. From his other wallets that I saw, this person seems to have scammed to tune of almost hundreds of thousands of dollars. This is what Binance is seeking -  \n\n'*An official Law Enforcement request raised by a police officer through the following link* [*https://www.binance.com/en/support/law-enforcement*](https://www.binance.com/en/support/law-enforcement) *from an official email address and attaching the following:*\n\n*A.

After researching the shit out of everything and talking with Binance support till late evening, I went to local cybercrime cell (*which I was not even sure if it existed in first place. I live in a Tier 3 city*) and they told me to go to State Cyber cell tomorrow morning. But from their google reviews I am pretty sure I won't get much help there either.

"social skills 101 for crypto bros saw a question on askmen subreddit ""what is the male version of astrology girl?"" and to no one is surprise crypto dude is one of the top answers.\n\nlet is be real here, we people who are into crypto have a bad reputation socially. we are at best socially inept, at worst cult-like. the stereotype of the crypto bros is one who tries to 'teach' them about crypto, and get them to convert their hard earned money to the sacred crypto. i have been on dates and the moment i talk about crypto, i can literal feel her pants tighten up, and help her remember that she has something important came up and need to end the date early.\n\nto help with dispelling this negative image of crypto bros, i decided to write up this post on how to improve our social skills with people.\n\nthe fundamental issue with crypto bros is basing his entire identity around crypto itself. to be fair, basing one is identity to a single thing, like religion, politics, work etc. is a horrible idea. life is a lot more than just crypto; have some fun hobbies, be proactive in your professional career, be involved in friends and families' lives. i get that you're passionate about crypto and how it will change your life, that doesn't mean you have to shove it down into other people is throat. it is like that annoying christian dude that won't shut up about jesus and somehow connecting every conversational topic to him.\n\ni am not advocating for people to actively hide the fact that they're into crypto, if it comes out in a conversation, it comes out. there is a huge difference in responding to the question ""what are you into?"" with ""i'm really into my job (or ""working towards my dream job"" if you hate your job), i'm into (some hobby), and like to trade some crypto on the side."" vs ""oh i'm really into crypto!"" followed by a 1 hour lecture on crypto. what i'm saying is that it is important to be a well-rounded person and not basing your entire identity on crypto alone.\n\nan unhealthy mentality crypto bros have is what i call the 'red pill' mentality, where they feel superior just because they're into crypto and the person they're talking to isn't. this same mentality is also commonly found in cults, conspiracy nuts and anti-vaxxers.\n\nanother important thing, read their body language. if when talking about crypto and you can see they're no longer attentive like looking away or just looking dead in the eye, change the topic. this applies to any conversational topic. if they're not into what you're into, that is ok. if they're interested in crypto, naturally they'll ask you more about it.\n\nremember a social interaction is a two-way street, where you share about what you're into, they share theirs, and establishing commonalities. it is not you shoving down your isuperior' crypto ways into their throats.",More like your ATOM,0

"Can we use DeXs in India to convert to INR using P2P thus avoiding the 30% crypto tax?I've been reading crypto tax and ways to circumvent it. I feel we should NOT give in to the 30% crypto tax. Protests starts from first NOT abiding by those laws forcing govt to make crypto friendly laws for everyone.\n\nI work as a freelancer and receive my payments (generally &lt; $500) in a single transaction using crypto. I used to receive it on Binance (a CeX) but now I think I should receive it on a DeX. I was thinking of going the route suggested by u/throwawaycryptotown of using a DeX and not reporting the gains to the government. I already use trust wallet and pancakeswap for swapping sometimes.\n\nI have 4 questions:\n\n1. I was thinking of using DyDx or pancakeswap. So I can technically receive all of that $500 on a DeX, not report that income or any further profits I make on it. But if I want to convert it to INR, does DeXs support P2P? How wud I get INR in my bank let's say after an year or two.\n\n2. If I use DeXs, then they mostly support normal spot trading. I like to do Futures trading. So if I use DeXs, I'll have to give that up? I saw pancakeswap.finance has a new domain as perp.pancakeswap.finance which supports perpetual trading but it does not support trust wallet. It has wallet connect support.\n\n3. \n\n3.1 CeXs like Binance provide hefty APYs of about 50% on a whole variety of coins but DeXs doesn't seem to do so except that farm/pool of that particular coin. I can't stake any other coin like USDT on pancakeswap or I wud have to do it using a USDT + Cake farm.\n\n3.2 Also, to stake or use a farm on pancakeswap (let's say the farm of Cake-BUSD or DOT-BNB or Link-BNB), I wud have to get BNB or Cake or Dot or Link ONLY OVER BEP20 to my trust wallet? Is this understanding correct? I faced an issue earlier where I transferred USDT over TRC20 and pancakeswap was showing my USDT balance as 0. So FOR ANY coin on pancakeswap, if I get it on BEP20, pancakeswap will allow me to use it for farms/pools? When I open Trust wallet, I can see the BNB and Cake over BEP20 but Dot or Link doesn't show any network. Is it by default BEP20? If I want to use Dot-BNB farm on pancakeswap, how should I get Dot in my trust wallet such that it shows as non-zero balance on pancakeswap?\n\n4. Also which wallet wud u recommend out of Trust wallet or binance wallet (not metamask due to huge fees). I am more inclined towards Trust wallet because I already am using it but if BSC wallet has more benefits, pls enlighten me.\n\nWhat should be the right way to go about it? Can u suggest any DeXs along with wallets which meets all the above criteria. Wud be really grateful for ur time and advice.",I get where you're coming from.

"how do i do taxes when i only have unrealized gains? in the past year i've bought and held a bit of crypto but have not really cashed any out. i do hold quite a bit on celsius and blockfi making passive interest. i also only made just a handful of trades (less than 10 easily). but i notice when i use sites like koinly, they look at all the transactions including my buying and transferring. because i exceed the free limit with these, it requires me to pay $100 to get a consolidated form.\n\neven though i haven't really made any realized gains and only a small amount of trades, do i really have to pay a fee for all of this? is there a simpler way to report on my taxes than having to pay out for a consolidated form on all my buy/transfer transactions? just got in to crypto last year so i could definitely use some help. thanks.","Really depends on your country.

"when transferring coins between exchanges, use xlm to be able to move around with virtually no fees! just started doing this recently and realised i couldve saved myself hundreds in fees if i had begun to do this earlier. its especially great if youre constantly moving around smaller amounts between exchanges and youre a frequent buyer of smaller cap coins from exchanges like kucoin like me. ill list the fees/withdrawal limits to give everyone a practical idea of how it works\n\nminimum binance withdrawal for btc is currently 0.001 which is ~40. every transacation comes at a cost of 0.0005 btc which is ~20/$28, meaning if youre looking to withdraw around 200/$280 youre already around 10% down. over time if youre frequently looking to buy smaller coins not listed on major, this really starts to add up.\n\nsimilarly with eth, minimum withdrawal amount is 0.016 which is ~45/$63 with a fee of 0.005 on every transaction which is around 15/$21 every transaction, looking to withdraw 200/$280 there and youre down around 8%.\n\nlooking at xlm, minimum withdrawal amount is 40 which is ~16/$22 at current prices. a what really stands out though is the transaction fee, youre looking at an 0.02 fee every time which is less than 0.01! \n\nthe great thing about xlm is that its also available on the vast majority of exchanges, so converting it back after is super easy. there are other coins which work with the tiny fees, but in terms of availability they arent always listed across exchanges so xlm is the perfect middle ground.",isnt tron or eos totally fee free so why use xlm?,0

"Can we use DeXs in India to convert to INR using P2P thus avoiding the 30% crypto tax?I've been reading crypto tax and ways to circumvent it. I feel we should NOT give in to the 30% crypto tax. Protests starts from first NOT abiding by those laws forcing govt to make crypto friendly laws for everyone.\n\nI work as a freelancer and receive my payments (generally &lt; $500) in a single transaction using crypto. I used to receive it on Binance (a CeX) but now I think I should receive it on a DeX. I was thinking of going the route suggested by u/throwawaycryptotown of using a DeX and not reporting the gains to the government. I already use trust wallet and pancakeswap for swapping sometimes.\n\nI have 4 questions:\n\n1. I was thinking of using DyDx or pancakeswap. So I can technically receive all of that $500 on a DeX, not report that income or any further profits I make on it. But if I want to convert it to INR, does DeXs support P2P? How wud I get INR in my bank let's say after an year or two.\n\n2. If I use DeXs, then they mostly support normal spot trading. I like to do Futures trading. So if I use DeXs, I'll have to give that up? I saw pancakeswap.finance has a new domain as perp.pancakeswap.finance which supports perpetual trading but it does not support trust wallet. It has wallet connect support.\n\n3. \n\n3.1 CeXs like Binance provide hefty APYs of about 50% on a whole variety of coins but DeXs doesn't seem to do so except that farm/pool of that particular coin. I can't stake any other coin like USDT on pancakeswap or I wud have to do it using a USDT + Cake farm.\n\n3.2 Also, to stake or use a farm on pancakeswap (let's say the farm of Cake-BUSD or DOT-BNB or Link-BNB), I wud have to get BNB or Cake or Dot or Link ONLY OVER BEP20 to my trust wallet? Is this understanding correct? I faced an issue earlier where I transferred USDT over TRC20 and pancakeswap was showing my USDT balance as 0. So FOR ANY coin on pancakeswap, if I get it on BEP20, pancakeswap will allow me to use it for farms/pools? When I open Trust wallet, I can see the BNB and Cake over BEP20 but Dot or Link doesn't show any network. Is it by default BEP20? If I want to use Dot-BNB farm on pancakeswap, how should I get Dot in my trust wallet such that it shows as non-zero balance on pancakeswap?\n\n4. Also which wallet wud u recommend out of Trust wallet or binance wallet (not metamask due to huge fees). I am more inclined towards Trust wallet because I already am using it but if BSC wallet has more benefits, pls enlighten me.\n\nWhat should be the right way to go about it? Can u suggest any DeXs along with wallets which meets all the above criteria. Wud be really grateful for ur time and advice.",How does that work?\n\nWill it be possible to meet buyers in person?

(you are god). based on that it is safer to say ""i invest in the top x coins"" instead of saying i only invest in coin x and coin y.\n2. investing in altcoins in addition to btc can increase your roi considerably. investing in top 7-10 coins tends to yield the most return in this case study (x3).\n3. based on #2, a crypto etf (or a similar service from exchanges that allow us to buy in bulk) could give exposure to the top x coins while saving transaction costs considerably.\n\nif you want more details, here is what your wallet would look like in each case of the above:\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ note:** this whole case study was a fun project and i was trying to answer some questions and thought to share it with you in case that would help you in any way. also it is important to not that history does not dictate the future, so please take all of what i present here with a grain of salt.\n\nmuch love!

This is called ýcold storageý. There are a few ways one can do this.\n\nFirst of all, paper wallets. They are nice for giving people small bitcoin gifts, but also for long-term storage if properly used. What you want to do is generate and print them offline. You can save the linked page https://www.bitaddress.org/ for example and run that offline. If you are really paranoid, you can put it on read-only media and access that from a different computer. For really long term storage, use archival-grade paper.\n\nAnother approach to take is using a separate computer for storing your money that is offline 99+% of the time. You could set one up easily by buying an old laptop, reformatting it, installing Linux and a Bitcoin client. Generate an address on that machine and send money to it from your main wallet. Depending on how paranoid you are you can connect that computer to the Internet afterwards to synchronize data with the Bitcoin Network and then turn it off and put it away somewhere safe until itýs needed.""",You just restore a wallet with the 24 words plus 25th on any new device.,0

It's a smart contract platform (*one that actually has smart contracts*) with growing institutional adoption.

And the investors that are here right now might be here just for the quick buck, but this could change very fast once they stumble upon a project that makes things easier/better for them and they have a reason and motivation to use it for something else than potential financial gains.

(you are god). based on that it is safer to say ""i invest in the top x coins"" instead of saying i only invest in coin x and coin y.\n2. investing in altcoins in addition to btc can increase your roi considerably. investing in top 7-10 coins tends to yield the most return in this case study (x3).\n3. based on #2, a crypto etf (or a similar service from exchanges that allow us to buy in bulk) could give exposure to the top x coins while saving transaction costs considerably.\n\nif you want more details, here is what your wallet would look like in each case of the above:\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ note:** this whole case study was a fun project and i was trying to answer some questions and thought to share it with you in case that would help you in any way. also it is important to not that history does not dictate the future, so please take all of what i present here with a grain of salt.\n\nmuch love!

just starting out hello! i'm new to crypto and wanted to see of any advice you all would be willing to share. so far i have a coinbase account and have just been watching it grow and fluctuate. i was thinking of going the route of using any disposable income to buy into the various coins. i've been tryin to keep up with all the information on here as well but most of what is posted is for those that have a better grip/have been doing it a bit longer. i'm willing to go the long haul and really believe in what crypto can do. any help would be great.,I would go to the Coinbureau YouTube channel and watch his educational videos on various cryptos. I would also recommend going to the dedicated websites for the crypto you're interested in and reading the white papers. I'd start with getting to understanding Bitcoin just to give you historical context for where all of this started and then branch out from there. Good luck and welcome!,0

"which is better: buying top coins vs. buying btc &amp; eth - (a 6 years dca case study) inspired by [this post]( i built a script to analyse if you dca'd blindly in the top crypto coins vs. investing in btc &amp; eth vs investing only in btc since the beginning of 2015, how much would your total worth is. here are the results.\n\n**numbers &amp; assumptions:**\n\n* dcaing takes place every week, on 1st, 8th, 15th and 22th of every month starting from jan 1st 2015 and until july 6th 2021.\n* investments budget per week is $100.\n* the weekly investment is divided equally on the coins invested in.\n* this case study is ignoring stable coin investments. e.g.: investing in the top 5 coins means the top 5 coins excluding any stable coins.\n* the analysis is assuming that you invested your money and never sold any coin till now.\n* total invested money over the whole dca period is $31,300.\n* transaction fees are not included in the analysis.\n\n**here are the results:**\n\n* if you blindly dca into the top 1 coins (btc), you will end up with **$1,102,104**.\n* if you blindly dca into the top 2 coins, you will end up with 4 coins (btc, xrp, ltc, eth) in your wallet and total worth of **$1,462,443**.\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 3 coins**, you will end up with 11 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,310,552.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 5 coins**, you will end up with 23 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,490,189.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 7 coins**, you will end up with 37 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,923,849.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 10 coins**, you will end up with 55 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,316,169.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 20 coins**, you will end up with 130 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,619,756.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 50 coins**, you will end up with 381 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$979,086.**\n* if you had a glass ball and knew that eth will be what it is today and you invested only in btc &amp; eth, you will end up with 2 coins in your wallet (surprise), and a total worth of **$4,505,477.**\n\n**some observations:**\n\n1. although it was relatively easier to guess that btc will be the #1 crypto coin back then, nobody would have guessed for sure that eth will be #2, so betting on btc &amp; eth only from the beginning would've been your strategy only if you know the future. (you are god). based on that it is safer to say ""i invest in the top x coins"" instead of saying i only invest in coin x and coin y.\n2. investing in altcoins in addition to btc can increase your roi considerably. investing in top 7-10 coins tends to yield the most return in this case study (x3).\n3. based on #2, a crypto etf (or a similar service from exchanges that allow us to buy in bulk) could give exposure to the top x coins while saving transaction costs considerably.\n\nif you want more details, here is what your wallet would look like in each case of the above:\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ note:** this whole case study was a fun project and i was trying to answer some questions and thought to share it with you in case that would help you in any way. also it is important to not that history does not dictate the future, so please take all of what i present here with a grain of salt.\n\nmuch love!

"when transferring coins between exchanges, use xlm to be able to move around with virtually no fees! just started doing this recently and realised i couldve saved myself hundreds in fees if i had begun to do this earlier. its especially great if youre constantly moving around smaller amounts between exchanges and youre a frequent buyer of smaller cap coins from exchanges like kucoin like me. ill list the fees/withdrawal limits to give everyone a practical idea of how it works\n\nminimum binance withdrawal for btc is currently 0.001 which is ~40. every transacation comes at a cost of 0.0005 btc which is ~20/$28, meaning if youre looking to withdraw around 200/$280 youre already around 10% down. over time if youre frequently looking to buy smaller coins not listed on major, this really starts to add up.\n\nsimilarly with eth, minimum withdrawal amount is 0.016 which is ~45/$63 with a fee of 0.005 on every transaction which is around 15/$21 every transaction, looking to withdraw 200/$280 there and youre down around 8%.\n\nlooking at xlm, minimum withdrawal amount is 40 which is ~16/$22 at current prices. a what really stands out though is the transaction fee, youre looking at an 0.02 fee every time which is less than 0.01! \n\nthe great thing about xlm is that its also available on the vast majority of exchanges, so converting it back after is super easy. there are other coins which work with the tiny fees, but in terms of availability they arent always listed across exchanges so xlm is the perfect middle ground.","You'll likely have to collect information on any trades you've done.

This means that you transform money into Nano and send it to your recipient.

"which is better: buying top coins vs. buying btc &amp; eth - (a 6 years dca case study) inspired by [this post]( i built a script to analyse if you dca'd blindly in the top crypto coins vs. investing in btc &amp; eth vs investing only in btc since the beginning of 2015, how much would your total worth is. here are the results.\n\n**numbers &amp; assumptions:**\n\n* dcaing takes place every week, on 1st, 8th, 15th and 22th of every month starting from jan 1st 2015 and until july 6th 2021.\n* investments budget per week is $100.\n* the weekly investment is divided equally on the coins invested in.\n* this case study is ignoring stable coin investments. e.g.: investing in the top 5 coins means the top 5 coins excluding any stable coins.\n* the analysis is assuming that you invested your money and never sold any coin till now.\n* total invested money over the whole dca period is $31,300.\n* transaction fees are not included in the analysis.\n\n**here are the results:**\n\n* if you blindly dca into the top 1 coins (btc), you will end up with **$1,102,104**.\n* if you blindly dca into the top 2 coins, you will end up with 4 coins (btc, xrp, ltc, eth) in your wallet and total worth of **$1,462,443**.\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 3 coins**, you will end up with 11 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,310,552.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 5 coins**, you will end up with 23 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,490,189.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 7 coins**, you will end up with 37 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,923,849.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 10 coins**, you will end up with 55 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,316,169.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 20 coins**, you will end up with 130 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,619,756.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 50 coins**, you will end up with 381 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$979,086.**\n* if you had a glass ball and knew that eth will be what it is today and you invested only in btc &amp; eth, you will end up with 2 coins in your wallet (surprise), and a total worth of **$4,505,477.**\n\n**some observations:**\n\n1. although it was relatively easier to guess that btc will be the #1 crypto coin back then, nobody would have guessed for sure that eth will be #2, so betting on btc &amp; eth only from the beginning would've been your strategy only if you know the future. (you are god). based on that it is safer to say ""i invest in the top x coins"" instead of saying i only invest in coin x and coin y.\n2. investing in altcoins in addition to btc can increase your roi considerably. investing in top 7-10 coins tends to yield the most return in this case study (x3).\n3. based on #2, a crypto etf (or a similar service from exchanges that allow us to buy in bulk) could give exposure to the top x coins while saving transaction costs considerably.\n\nif you want more details, here is what your wallet would look like in each case of the above:\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ note:** this whole case study was a fun project and i was trying to answer some questions and thought to share it with you in case that would help you in any way. also it is important to not that history does not dictate the future, so please take all of what i present here with a grain of salt.\n\nmuch love!

"is bitcoin is value solely based on the greater fool theory? disclaimer: i actually hold btc myself as an investment, but i'm really wondering what intrinsic value and use case bitcoin has.\njust to clarify, i do understand most of the technical details of bitcoin like mining, proof of work and the 21 million cap. \nthe greater fool theory is basically the idea that the price of an asset is determined by how much others are willing to pay for it. basically people buy something because they can sell it for more to a greater fool, who then hopes they can sell it to an even greater fool thus leading to the price continuing to grow as more and more people buy in. i'm sure we've all seen the likes of r/technology calling this ponzi/pyramid/mlm which isn't exactly what it is, but the idea is the same. \ni'm playing devil is advocate here, but what really sets btc apart from speculative bubbles like dutch tulips or beanie babies? as in why would you buy bitcoin other than hoping to sell it for more later? it was originally intended to be electronic cash but it obviously didn't go that route. \nif you say it is a store of value (which i understand why) it doesn't seem to hold stable value as of present, like precious metals do. will the price stabilise in the future or do we just hope it will?\nif you say the lack of barriers to easily transfer value anywhere in the world, there is plenty of much more efficient blockchain technologies that do it much better than btc.\nif you say decentralisation, that is not what the majority are buying btc for. they (including many of us) just want to make money. how much intrinsic value does it really provide?\njust to reiterate, i'm not against bitcoin. i am just wondering if anyone has some convincing counterarguments to these criticisms and a lot of others, instead of just saying the people who make these arguments are ignorant or uneducated (though some may be).\nif you have any other criticisms of btc feel free to share, and i would love to hear some rebuttals to other common claims made by the likes of r/technology.",FALSE.

"do you guys actually use or would use crypto as a form of payment right now? (if there was a wider use in public) i personally see crypto as a form of investment and not as a currency tbh. not yet atleast.\ni truly believe crypto is going to be the future but i just cant imagine, even in the near future to use a extremely volatile crypto as a form of payment. \n\nlike lets say the price of a pizza i could buy today is 0.0002 btc = 10.\nbut since btc is so volatile that price of 10 for a pizza must be updated like every minute and that just sounds kinda confusing and complicated because the 0.0002 btc tomorrow could be worth 12.\n\nand even if there was a wider use in the public (stores, restaurants etc.) i personally wouldnt use my bitcoin as payment as of now. \ni did order something for 50 bucks off the internet around september and used bitcoin as a payment. if i would have just used paypal the 0.005 btc i payed would have been 240 today. \nso what i want to point out is, i wouldnt want to pay with my 50 bitcoin that potentially could be worth double the price in a month.\n\nenglish is not my first language so i hope i could explain my ""concern"" :)\n\nbut i actually dont know if thats something of significance. does that even matter? and if yes what would have to change?","No, its purely an investment.",0

"How to get USDT at a reasonable rate?It?s baffling to see the prices of USDT on Binance P2P. The markup is insane. The same goes for all the other cryptos being sold through P2P.

Well, I don't really invest much in Bitcoin, but rather in various alternative coins depending on your long-term plan for your newfound crypto wealth. We are all aware that crypto investment carries a significant risk, but also a huge gain. Many risk takers, I would say, are enticed to acquire Bitcoin at the lowest price and invest it with the appropriate platform for a higher rate and receive double with the right platform and HODL. Basically, you could profit from your purchase as an investment, but you must do it with caution, invest wisely, and always DYOR.

"which is better: buying top coins vs. buying btc &amp; eth - (a 6 years dca case study) inspired by [this post]( i built a script to analyse if you dca'd blindly in the top crypto coins vs. investing in btc &amp; eth vs investing only in btc since the beginning of 2015, how much would your total worth is. here are the results.\n\n**numbers &amp; assumptions:**\n\n* dcaing takes place every week, on 1st, 8th, 15th and 22th of every month starting from jan 1st 2015 and until july 6th 2021.\n* investments budget per week is $100.\n* the weekly investment is divided equally on the coins invested in.\n* this case study is ignoring stable coin investments. e.g.: investing in the top 5 coins means the top 5 coins excluding any stable coins.\n* the analysis is assuming that you invested your money and never sold any coin till now.\n* total invested money over the whole dca period is $31,300.\n* transaction fees are not included in the analysis.\n\n**here are the results:**\n\n* if you blindly dca into the top 1 coins (btc), you will end up with **$1,102,104**.\n* if you blindly dca into the top 2 coins, you will end up with 4 coins (btc, xrp, ltc, eth) in your wallet and total worth of **$1,462,443**.\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 3 coins**, you will end up with 11 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,310,552.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 5 coins**, you will end up with 23 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,490,189.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 7 coins**, you will end up with 37 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,923,849.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 10 coins**, you will end up with 55 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,316,169.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 20 coins**, you will end up with 130 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,619,756.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 50 coins**, you will end up with 381 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$979,086.**\n* if you had a glass ball and knew that eth will be what it is today and you invested only in btc &amp; eth, you will end up with 2 coins in your wallet (surprise), and a total worth of **$4,505,477.**\n\n**some observations:**\n\n1. although it was relatively easier to guess that btc will be the #1 crypto coin back then, nobody would have guessed for sure that eth will be #2, so betting on btc &amp; eth only from the beginning would've been your strategy only if you know the future.

Only difference: it doesn't come back up afterwards. So it just dips like 30% for 3 times in a row and people will still claim 'it will go back up'. There were also unconvincing reasons for this going around, e.g. 'it's down because of the Chinese new year' but it will 'go up after Wall Street gets their bonuses', which is to this day joked about on this sub as you might have seen. \n\nSo DLDR: you don't realize when the bull run is over before it's too late.

Blockchain is basically a database that is maintained by 100s, 1000s maybe 10.000s of people. With a normal database, only one person/company can change the data, meaning that you, as a customer, have to trust the company to do what's best for your interest. Unfortunately time and time again we're reminded that companies do not have our best interest in mind, only money. Look for Ticketmaster and scalpers, you'll find Ticketmaster has been Enabling scalpers instead of fighting against them. That's where blockchain shines through; instead of trusting a single entity, a change in data must be verified by 1000s of people and the result is visible to all, which means you don't have to trust a person/company to do the right thing. Blockchain only approves the right thing and everyone can verify what happened.\n\nSo, there are projects, that use this transparancy to build trustless systems, which are exactly what they sound like.\n\nCrypto projects are nothing more than startups using this new technology to create a new product.

(you are god). based on that it is safer to say ""i invest in the top x coins"" instead of saying i only invest in coin x and coin y.\n2. investing in altcoins in addition to btc can increase your roi considerably. investing in top 7-10 coins tends to yield the most return in this case study (x3).\n3. based on #2, a crypto etf (or a similar service from exchanges that allow us to buy in bulk) could give exposure to the top x coins while saving transaction costs considerably.\n\nif you want more details, here is what your wallet would look like in each case of the above:\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ note:** this whole case study was a fun project and i was trying to answer some questions and thought to share it with you in case that would help you in any way. also it is important to not that history does not dictate the future, so please take all of what i present here with a grain of salt.\n\nmuch love!

"Can we use DeXs in India to convert to INR using P2P thus avoiding the 30% crypto tax?I've been reading crypto tax and ways to circumvent it. I feel we should NOT give in to the 30% crypto tax. Protests starts from first NOT abiding by those laws forcing govt to make crypto friendly laws for everyone.\n\nI work as a freelancer and receive my payments (generally &lt; $500) in a single transaction using crypto. I used to receive it on Binance (a CeX) but now I think I should receive it on a DeX. I was thinking of going the route suggested by u/throwawaycryptotown of using a DeX and not reporting the gains to the government. I already use trust wallet and pancakeswap for swapping sometimes.\n\nI have 4 questions:\n\n1. I was thinking of using DyDx or pancakeswap. So I can technically receive all of that $500 on a DeX, not report that income or any further profits I make on it. But if I want to convert it to INR, does DeXs support P2P? How wud I get INR in my bank let's say after an year or two.\n\n2. If I use DeXs, then they mostly support normal spot trading. I like to do Futures trading. So if I use DeXs, I'll have to give that up? I saw pancakeswap.finance has a new domain as perp.pancakeswap.finance which supports perpetual trading but it does not support trust wallet. It has wallet connect support.\n\n3. \n\n3.1 CeXs like Binance provide hefty APYs of about 50% on a whole variety of coins but DeXs doesn't seem to do so except that farm/pool of that particular coin. I can't stake any other coin like USDT on pancakeswap or I wud have to do it using a USDT + Cake farm.\n\n3.2 Also, to stake or use a farm on pancakeswap (let's say the farm of Cake-BUSD or DOT-BNB or Link-BNB), I wud have to get BNB or Cake or Dot or Link ONLY OVER BEP20 to my trust wallet? Is this understanding correct? I faced an issue earlier where I transferred USDT over TRC20 and pancakeswap was showing my USDT balance as 0. So FOR ANY coin on pancakeswap, if I get it on BEP20, pancakeswap will allow me to use it for farms/pools? When I open Trust wallet, I can see the BNB and Cake over BEP20 but Dot or Link doesn't show any network. Is it by default BEP20? If I want to use Dot-BNB farm on pancakeswap, how should I get Dot in my trust wallet such that it shows as non-zero balance on pancakeswap?\n\n4. Also which wallet wud u recommend out of Trust wallet or binance wallet (not metamask due to huge fees). I am more inclined towards Trust wallet because I already am using it but if BSC wallet has more benefits, pls enlighten me.\n\nWhat should be the right way to go about it?

"Can we use DeXs in India to convert to INR using P2P thus avoiding the 30% crypto tax?I've been reading crypto tax and ways to circumvent it. I feel we should NOT give in to the 30% crypto tax. Protests starts from first NOT abiding by those laws forcing govt to make crypto friendly laws for everyone.\n\nI work as a freelancer and receive my payments (generally &lt; $500) in a single transaction using crypto. I used to receive it on Binance (a CeX) but now I think I should receive it on a DeX. I was thinking of going the route suggested by u/throwawaycryptotown of using a DeX and not reporting the gains to the government. I already use trust wallet and pancakeswap for swapping sometimes.\n\nI have 4 questions:\n\n1. I was thinking of using DyDx or pancakeswap. So I can technically receive all of that $500 on a DeX, not report that income or any further profits I make on it. But if I want to convert it to INR, does DeXs support P2P? How wud I get INR in my bank let's say after an year or two.\n\n2. If I use DeXs, then they mostly support normal spot trading. I like to do Futures trading. So if I use DeXs, I'll have to give that up? I saw pancakeswap.finance has a new domain as perp.pancakeswap.finance which supports perpetual trading but it does not support trust wallet. It has wallet connect support.\n\n3. \n\n3.1 CeXs like Binance provide hefty APYs of about 50% on a whole variety of coins but DeXs doesn't seem to do so except that farm/pool of that particular coin. I can't stake any other coin like USDT on pancakeswap or I wud have to do it using a USDT + Cake farm.\n\n3.2 Also, to stake or use a farm on pancakeswap (let's say the farm of Cake-BUSD or DOT-BNB or Link-BNB), I wud have to get BNB or Cake or Dot or Link ONLY OVER BEP20 to my trust wallet? Is this understanding correct? I faced an issue earlier where I transferred USDT over TRC20 and pancakeswap was showing my USDT balance as 0. So FOR ANY coin on pancakeswap, if I get it on BEP20, pancakeswap will allow me to use it for farms/pools? When I open Trust wallet, I can see the BNB and Cake over BEP20 but Dot or Link doesn't show any network. Is it by default BEP20? If I want to use Dot-BNB farm on pancakeswap, how should I get Dot in my trust wallet such that it shows as non-zero balance on pancakeswap?\n\n4. Also which wallet wud u recommend out of Trust wallet or binance wallet (not metamask due to huge fees). I am more inclined towards Trust wallet because I already am using it but if BSC wallet has more benefits, pls enlighten me.\n\nWhat should be the right way to go about it? Can u suggest any DeXs along with wallets which meets all the above criteria. Wud be really grateful for ur time and advice.","This sounds crazy, why pay tax on something you declare illegal?\nThis is the major reason privacy solutions will gain more adoption at a time of regulation like this.\n\nHaving this knowledge of them making crypto illegal I will rather remain anonymous and not pay tax since it's illegal and if I will have to then I can use a Railgun at least a part of the smart contract allows the user to generate a verifiable report of transactions and balances which can be used for tax compliance purposes.",0

I had my Bitcoins distributed amongst them.  \n\nI can tell you, from experience, that my hardware wallet didn't cost much more than the R-Pi setup.  Memorizing 24 words is a lot easier than memorizing a lot of private keys.  The papers that the seed phrases are written on are tiny compared to writing out all those private keys - this makes them easier to hide.  A nearly infinite number of addresses can be generated from one seed phrase.  \n\nI'm sorry if two or three hundred dollars is a lot of money for you.  For me, it's been part of my overall investment.  Less than three hundred dollars to be able to secure my retirement savings has been worth it.  \n\nThe device I bought uses open source code, which I am able to read.  If you can't read the code yourself, you can safely bet that the competitors have scrutinized it, hoping to find a piece of maliciousness within, so they could bash their competitors, ruin their reputation and drive them out of business.  \n\nThe hardware generates receive addresses for me and it can sign any ""spend"" transactions for me.  It can also generate an xpub, for example, if I want a watch-only wallet.  The device remains forever disconnected from the Internet.  It requires a long PIN number to be entered correctly within a certain number of tries else it bricks itself.  I'd say it's money well spent.  \n\nThe people I bought it from knew my name and home address at some point.  Supposedly, they'd deleted that information.  Even if they haven't, even if the police/government violate my rights, come to my door and KNOW that I bought a Bitcoin hardware wallet at some point, they'll never be able to take my Bitcoins.  After all, I did have a boating accident...  and, maybe I have a ""duress"" wallet.  \n\nMeanwhile, people have been losing their Bitcoins by using malicious on-line ""paper wallet"" generators.  Others have imported their private keys, instead of ""sweeping"" them, and they lost Bitcoins when they tried to spend some of the balance but the ""change"" got sent to who-knows-where.  Others have sent their private keys and QR code to their printer, then tossed out or recycled their printer without realizing their private keys were STILL intact within the printer's memory.",0
"is bitcoin is value solely based on the greater fool theory? disclaimer: i actually hold btc myself as an investment, but i'm really wondering what intrinsic value and use case bitcoin has.\njust to clarify, i do understand most of the technical details of bitcoin like mining, proof of work and the 21 million cap. \nthe greater fool theory is basically the idea that the price of an asset is determined by how much others are willing to pay for it. basically people buy something because they can sell it for more to a greater fool, who then hopes they can sell it to an even greater fool thus leading to the price continuing to grow as more and more people buy in. i'm sure we've all seen the likes of r/technology calling this ponzi/pyramid/mlm which isn't exactly what it is, but the idea is the same. \ni'm playing devil is advocate here, but what really sets btc apart from speculative bubbles like dutch tulips or beanie babies? as in why would you buy bitcoin other than hoping to sell it for more later? it was originally intended to be electronic cash but it obviously didn't go that route. \nif you say it is a store of value (which i understand why) it doesn't seem to hold stable value as of present, like precious metals do. will the price stabilise in the future or do we just hope it will?\nif you say the lack of barriers to easily transfer value anywhere in the world, there is plenty of much more efficient blockchain technologies that do it much better than btc.\nif you say decentralisation, that is not what the majority are buying btc for. they (including many of us) just want to make money. how much intrinsic value does it really provide?\njust to reiterate, i'm not against bitcoin. i am just wondering if anyone has some convincing counterarguments to these criticisms and a lot of others, instead of just saying the people who make these arguments are ignorant or uneducated (though some may be).\nif you have any other criticisms of btc feel free to share, and i would love to hear some rebuttals to other common claims made by the likes of r/technology.","Thus the paradox.

How to Bootstrap a Profitable Lightning Node,"Yes, that extra laptop that runs 24/7 should suffice. To begin with, a lightning node + Bitcoin node and a lot of other supplementary tools can initially be setup to run even on a tiny device like Raspberry pi 4, so along as your extra laptop has better specs than a pi4 you're golden. \n\nAlso, yes, 1 TB would be sufficient, however from what I've noticed an SSD is what would significantly help with the I/O operations since blocks are downloaded constantly on the Bitcoin node. Also, if you would like to query blockchain data reliably and quicker through wallet apps you'll probably need that SSD. An external SSD works well (Like the Samsung T5 or T7) if you can't have one installed internally on your laptop for any reason. \n\nHere are the current disk space usage details:\n\n1) Bitcoin Core full node (full relay) - About 463 GB with txindex and blockfilterindex enabled.  \n2) Electrum Server (Electrum server to connect to wallets that require an electrum SPV server) - If you're using Electrs it uses about 35 GB,  OR if you use Fulcrum which is [much more performant by about 300x faster than electrs for querying block data](https://twitter.com/craigraw/status/1488470446211321856) it uses about 102 GB.  \n3) LND's channel DB size will increase a lot over time as more channels are opened, especially if you setup a public routing node. So the disk space usage here is variable.  \n4) Running other stuff like Btc-rpc-server (your own Bitcoin block explorer), mempool, thunderhub, Ride-The-Lightning (RTL) and possibly a pihole are all supplemental to the above 3 and doesn't use much disk space, but could consume some processor and memory depending on usage.",1

"since currency coins are finally getting some attention, heres one to look out for if your a member of this sub you may have already heard people raving about nano. why do they think its so great?\n\nthe core reason for the love it gets is the simplicity in transacting over any other coin. i encourage you to download natrium from your phones app store, then head to a nano faucet by searching on google and get yourself some free nano.\n\ntry sending the free nano you get between another phone or pc and youll see what i mean by simplicity and ease of use.\n\nnano transaction are feeless and instant. it is also relatively decentralised with a nakamoto coefficient of 11 entities.\n\nthere is 0 inflation with nano, the team currently holds less than 1% of the supply and there will only ever be 133 million nano in circulation.\n\nas far as currency coins go it may risky due to its unique technology, but i think its definitely a risk worth taking right now while its out of the top 100 cryptocurrencies. theres a lot of potential if people start catching onto its fundamentals.\n\neven if you dont think you hear anything special i really encourage you to try nano out, i was honestly shocked the first time i used it after spending so many fees with eth.","I prefer Nyano.\n\nThe fast, feeless, feline.",0
"dear crypto maniacs, what cryptocurrency do you have the most and why do you believe that it is the right choice? i think the answers to this post can be interesting and instructive. i am interested in other people is thoughts and interests. i concluded that a lot of us believe in the growth of one coin/project more then the other ones. which ones are your favourites and why?",Lol,0
"do you think any project will ever overtake bitcoin and ethereum by marketcap? bitcoin is king and ethereum is queen in the crypto space right now. they both are gargantuan market caps and are the two cryptos that even the average person has probably heard of.\n\nwe know that with technology, advancements are made at rapid paces and revolutionary pieces of technology are being worked on everyday. now i know that it isnt always the best tech that wins because marketing, first mover advantage etc play a role. however, i do think the cream will rise to the top as more and more people get educated about crypto.\n\nwe all talk about the flippening aka eth taking over btc in marketcap. however, do you see any alts overtaking both in the long term? obviously if this is to ever happen, the project that achieves it would have to have exceptional utility, marketing and be ready to be applied in the real world. what are yours thoughts? could this ever happen? which project has the potential to flip both?","Good for Bitcoin, any things that enter Blockchain will lead to Btc. \n\nBitcoin is like a blackhole.",0
"just found a really interesting project (oxygen - oxy) # \n\n i've found this interesting project while browsing for a good crypto on kraken: [ is not financial advice\*!&lt;\n\ni read about it and bought 20$ worth of it, i think it is worth it.\n\nit is decentralized and built on top of solana, so very little commissions.\n\nit is a promising crypto project and i hope its price will increase in time.\n\ni'm really shocked that it isn't talked about in this sub. \nwhat do you folks think?",>It's a promising crypto project and I hope its price will increase in time.\n\n>I'm really shocked that it isn't talked about in this sub.\n\nYou didn't say a single word about why it's promising or people should talk about it.

could we be seeing a bullrun this year? if so when? im kinda new to this and i have never seen a real bullrun where stocks/crypto has gained hundreds of percent in a day and gone up like crazy. but i did go through the recovery phase after covid. so im wondering could we be seeing a bullrun this year? and if so is it most likely to happen in late november-december?\n\nive seen some posts about this and thats why im curious to see your thoughts and ideas about it. and if a bullrun would happen does it affect all stocks and crypto or just some?\n\nthanks in advance,Love a lengthy bull,0
"what is your favorite pricacy coin and why is it monero? over the past few years, regulators such as the sec and irs are watching us crypto-nerds fading away from investing into banking funds or etfs and putting our money into crypto because we **know** about the potential of crypto. they force us to pay inhuman taxes, other countries even watch **everything** we do on crypto.\n\nsince monero is the only truly anonymous and fungible crypto there is *(excluding less-popular ones)*, **irs offered a six-digit reward to anyone being able to crack it is protocol** \- guess what? **it never happened.**\n\nwhat are your thoughts about monero? do you care about privacy at all? maybe you use monero as a layover?\n\nmaybe you're already using the atomic swap technology to convert your btc to xmr or vice versa?\n\nwhere do you see monero in the next years?\n\ntell me your thoughts!",I don't even have a boat but I'm still scared of Monero.,0
"favorite exchange coinbase is killing me with fees. and i don't like binance is 10-day hold, plus they seem a little shady. unfortunately, i'm vested in both, but looking to move all my business to a new one if it makes sense. if you had to do it all over again, which exchange would you use?","Coinbase was quicker to verify me plus the debit card purchase was nice, but I feel ya on the fees, OUTRAGEOUS. I been using Binance.US since but the 10 day hold is ridiculous too, so basically I agree with your post and offer no solution =",0
"question: am i spreading myself too thin? this question is mainly for seasoned crypto investors. i am a new to crypto and i plan to dca $150 a week ($600 per month) into six assets broken down as follows:\n\n30%, 20%, 14%, 14%, 12%, 10%\n\nshould i minimize the amount of assets i have or do you think i am fine? i don't have a stop date for these weekly purchases, but i can see myself reassessing in a few years. \n\nthanks!",Just be careful what you invest in.
