"what are the best low and medium risk options to make some gains on my money in the crypto space? hey,\n\ni want to help make myself some reasonably secure and non-volatile profits from crypto. i'm currently making a bank beating 10% on stable coins on crypto.com and that seems like a pretty good relatively low risk approach for some of my money. \n\ni'm invested in a number of the more volatile cryptos, but i cant afford to lose more than im already investing there. (i dca in on those investments)\n\nare there places paying better returns on staking/lending of stables that anyone is aware of?\n\nalso, i'm willing to accept a bit higher risk than stable staking as well with a portion of my money, but not as much risk as say just holding bitcoin or alts, because its money i would need in the next few months and a market drop is definitely possible. are there any opportunities for me to make my money work for me and generate a bit of income say 15/20% apy with a like... medium level of risk?

seeking advice. i just became director of technology for a fairly large trucking company in the midwest. my first order of business was forcing the adoption of brave browser company wide for our 100+ employees in the name of privacy and security. while i've been a contractor just writing software for them over the last 5 years i've been quite the crypto evangelist and have piqued a lot of interest from both co-workers and decision makers. now that i have decision making sway it is my goal to integrate tools into the working environment to gain even further exposure to my co-workers and employees of the company.\n\nwhat are some other business ready tools that i can look at as viable replacements for technology you use on a daily basis that are not cumbersome to your working environment?\n\ni have some long term goals with supply chain on the blockchain that i am developing as poc for how we manage our assets currently. i'm not sure if our c level positions are quite ready for that level of blockchain commitment. i'm trying to ease everyone into comfortability with the blockchain.\n\ni'm open to any types of tools that can accomplish this type of evangelism mixed with day to day usage. i will review them all thoroughly. \n\ni am at the phase of trying to educate and build trust in crypto. please keep that in mind if you respond.,Way to go.

"can somebody help me understand why crypto is a hedge against inflation? i understand that if the value of fiat goes down, then your fiat is worth less in terms of purchasing power ($1 used to be able to buy x, but now it takes $2 to buy x). but if you have to convert crypto to fiat to utilize its purchasing potential, then isnt it essentially subject to the same inflation depreciation? i guess when you can start purchasing things with crypto it takes the fiat middle man out and they are not tied together, but i still feel like people will be thinking in terms of fiat equivalency. for example, you want to pay for something that would cost 100 crypto, wouldnt the person selling know how much that crypto would equal in fiat and want to make sure they are appropriately pricing it? and if so, wouldnt they then take fiat inflation into account? ive never paid for anything using cryptocurrency so i dont really know how it flies down logistically. does the cost of the food or service continually fluctuate with price fluctuations in the crypto? really appreciate any insight","Its a hedge because the returns are so much higher than the ~20% inflation rate.

anyone feel making big money day trading crypto would be easy if you were rich? this might be a silly topic but i was thinking if i had thousands of dollars to throw around with no risk (ie being rich) i feel like it wouldn't be too difficult to look for the dip of certain cryptos- throw a few thousand bucks into them and sell them right when it pumps. \n\nas someone not rich my strategy is more to hold promising cryptos (as well as stake in many cases) for the long term. \n\ni'm sure my scenario is basically what some whales do. as a side note that'd partially why i'm not impressed when people say they're self made but were loaned millions of dollars by their dad lol,You can make money even if you're not rich.

"social skills 101 for crypto bros saw a question on askmen subreddit ""what is the male version of astrology girl?"" and to no one is surprise crypto dude is one of the top answers.\n\nlet is be real here, we people who are into crypto have a bad reputation socially. we are at best socially inept, at worst cult-like. the stereotype of the crypto bros is one who tries to 'teach' them about crypto, and get them to convert their hard earned money to the sacred crypto. i have been on dates and the moment i talk about crypto, i can literal feel her pants tighten up, and help her remember that she has something important came up and need to end the date early.\n\nto help with dispelling this negative image of crypto bros, i decided to write up this post on how to improve our social skills with people.\n\nthe fundamental issue with crypto bros is basing his entire identity around crypto itself. to be fair, basing one is identity to a single thing, like religion, politics, work etc. is a horrible idea. life is a lot more than just crypto; have some fun hobbies, be proactive in your professional career, be involved in friends and families' lives. i get that you're passionate about crypto and how it will change your life, that doesn't mean you have to shove it down into other people is throat. it is like that annoying christian dude that won't shut up about jesus and somehow connecting every conversational topic to him.\n\ni am not advocating for people to actively hide the fact that they're into crypto, if it comes out in a conversation, it comes out. there is a huge difference in responding to the question ""what are you into?"" with ""i'm really into my job (or ""working towards my dream job"" if you hate your job), i'm into (some hobby), and like to trade some crypto on the side."" vs ""oh i'm really into crypto!"" followed by a 1 hour lecture on crypto. what i'm saying is that it is important to be a well-rounded person and not basing your entire identity on crypto alone.\n\nan unhealthy mentality crypto bros have is what i call the 'red pill' mentality, where they feel superior just because they're into crypto and the person they're talking to isn't. this same mentality is also commonly found in cults, conspiracy nuts and anti-vaxxers.\n\nanother important thing, read their body language. if when talking about crypto and you can see they're no longer attentive like looking away or just looking dead in the eye, change the topic. this applies to any conversational topic. if they're not into what you're into, that is ok. if they're interested in crypto, naturally they'll ask you more about it.\n\nremember a social interaction is a two-way street, where you share about what you're into, they share theirs, and establishing commonalities. it is not you shoving down your isuperior' crypto ways into their throats.","Jokes on you, I'm antisocial so I don't even talk to people!

(you are god). based on that it is safer to say ""i invest in the top x coins"" instead of saying i only invest in coin x and coin y.\n2. investing in altcoins in addition to btc can increase your roi considerably. investing in top 7-10 coins tends to yield the most return in this case study (x3).\n3. based on #2, a crypto etf (or a similar service from exchanges that allow us to buy in bulk) could give exposure to the top x coins while saving transaction costs considerably.\n\nif you want more details, here is what your wallet would look like in each case of the above:\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ note:** this whole case study was a fun project and i was trying to answer some questions and thought to share it with you in case that would help you in any way. also it is important to not that history does not dictate the future, so please take all of what i present here with a grain of salt.\n\nmuch love!

"social skills 101 for crypto bros saw a question on askmen subreddit ""what is the male version of astrology girl?"" and to no one is surprise crypto dude is one of the top answers.\n\nlet is be real here, we people who are into crypto have a bad reputation socially. we are at best socially inept, at worst cult-like. the stereotype of the crypto bros is one who tries to 'teach' them about crypto, and get them to convert their hard earned money to the sacred crypto. i have been on dates and the moment i talk about crypto, i can literal feel her pants tighten up, and help her remember that she has something important came up and need to end the date early.\n\nto help with dispelling this negative image of crypto bros, i decided to write up this post on how to improve our social skills with people.\n\nthe fundamental issue with crypto bros is basing his entire identity around crypto itself. to be fair, basing one is identity to a single thing, like religion, politics, work etc. is a horrible idea. life is a lot more than just crypto; have some fun hobbies, be proactive in your professional career, be involved in friends and families' lives. i get that you're passionate about crypto and how it will change your life, that doesn't mean you have to shove it down into other people is throat. it is like that annoying christian dude that won't shut up about jesus and somehow connecting every conversational topic to him.\n\ni am not advocating for people to actively hide the fact that they're into crypto, if it comes out in a conversation, it comes out. there is a huge difference in responding to the question ""what are you into?"" with ""i'm really into my job (or ""working towards my dream job"" if you hate your job), i'm into (some hobby), and like to trade some crypto on the side."" vs ""oh i'm really into crypto!"" followed by a 1 hour lecture on crypto. what i'm saying is that it is important to be a well-rounded person and not basing your entire identity on crypto alone.\n\nan unhealthy mentality crypto bros have is what i call the 'red pill' mentality, where they feel superior just because they're into crypto and the person they're talking to isn't. this same mentality is also commonly found in cults, conspiracy nuts and anti-vaxxers.\n\nanother important thing, read their body language. if when talking about crypto and you can see they're no longer attentive like looking away or just looking dead in the eye, change the topic. this applies to any conversational topic. if they're not into what you're into, that is ok. if they're interested in crypto, naturally they'll ask you more about it.\n\nremember a social interaction is a two-way street, where you share about what you're into, they share theirs, and establishing commonalities. it is not you shoving down your isuperior' crypto ways into their throats.","Hold your coins, Crypto ain't cool? ![gif](emote|emo_pack_1|i_dunno)",0

"which is better: buying top coins vs. buying btc &amp; eth - (a 6 years dca case study) inspired by [this post]( i built a script to analyse if you dca'd blindly in the top crypto coins vs. investing in btc &amp; eth vs investing only in btc since the beginning of 2015, how much would your total worth is. here are the results.\n\n**numbers &amp; assumptions:**\n\n* dcaing takes place every week, on 1st, 8th, 15th and 22th of every month starting from jan 1st 2015 and until july 6th 2021.\n* investments budget per week is $100.\n* the weekly investment is divided equally on the coins invested in.\n* this case study is ignoring stable coin investments. e.g.: investing in the top 5 coins means the top 5 coins excluding any stable coins.\n* the analysis is assuming that you invested your money and never sold any coin till now.\n* total invested money over the whole dca period is $31,300.\n* transaction fees are not included in the analysis.\n\n**here are the results:**\n\n* if you blindly dca into the top 1 coins (btc), you will end up with **$1,102,104**.\n* if you blindly dca into the top 2 coins, you will end up with 4 coins (btc, xrp, ltc, eth) in your wallet and total worth of **$1,462,443**.\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 3 coins**, you will end up with 11 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,310,552.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 5 coins**, you will end up with 23 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,490,189.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 7 coins**, you will end up with 37 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,923,849.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 10 coins**, you will end up with 55 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,316,169.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 20 coins**, you will end up with 130 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,619,756.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 50 coins**, you will end up with 381 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$979,086.**\n* if you had a glass ball and knew that eth will be what it is today and you invested only in btc &amp; eth, you will end up with 2 coins in your wallet (surprise), and a total worth of **$4,505,477.**\n\n**some observations:**\n\n1. although it was relatively easier to guess that btc will be the #1 crypto coin back then, nobody would have guessed for sure that eth will be #2, so betting on btc &amp; eth only from the beginning would've been your strategy only if you know the future. (you are god). based on that it is safer to say ""i invest in the top x coins"" instead of saying i only invest in coin x and coin y.\n2. investing in altcoins in addition to btc can increase your roi considerably. investing in top 7-10 coins tends to yield the most return in this case study (x3).\n3. based on #2, a crypto etf (or a similar service from exchanges that allow us to buy in bulk) could give exposure to the top x coins while saving transaction costs considerably.\n\nif you want more details, here is what your wallet would look like in each case of the above:\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ note:** this whole case study was a fun project and i was trying to answer some questions and thought to share it with you in case that would help you in any way. also it is important to not that history does not dictate the future, so please take all of what i present here with a grain of salt.\n\nmuch love!

Personally Id probably go some higher on ETH but thats really matter of believe kinda. \n\nOn the transfers to a HW wallet Id say reasonable intervals would depend on amount vs. fees. After 6 months youd have bit shy of 1000$ on the exchange which in all honesty isnt THAT big of a risk especially with a reputable exchange like KC so you might as well just transfer yearly so you lose less of the potential gains in fees and you can time them to lower fees e.g. Sunday US night time usually is better/lower \n\nanother thing you might want to check out is stacking your coins ... so asides of the coin value gain some interest rates ... if you plan to hold long term anyways, getting a few % APY can be a nice extra gain.

"how to swing trade bitcoin sorry for this super noob question i just started trading this week. so lemme just make sure i'm gettin this straight. i put in 100$ at a low time, it goes up and i have 110$ now. i think the market is going to drop, so what do i do? do i take out the 10$ profit and let the 100$ stay in hopes of it not dropping? do i take out everything and hope it drops, then put the original 100$ back in when it is back down again?","Cool man, glad it helped. \n\nIf youre going to get into BTC, Id say buy and hold and do your research and studying up in the meantime. If its money you wont miss, it wont matter if the price drops since you can just wait it out for a rise. Of course, even if the price rises by 20% tomorrow, the question is then do you continue to hold, or sell, in which case it can still rise and make it harder to buy back.\n\nNo one can tell you the answer sadly; there are people still holding from the all time high in 2017, but there are people making money too.\n\nAnother option is selling your BTC on a p2p exchange. In the side bar are some suggestions for p2p exchanges where you can sell what you hold for a price you want, with more of a likelihood of selling if your offer is near the current price. Then you just buy more with your profits; of course theres no guarantee, but if you dont get greedy with pricing I think you can do business (but Ive never done this).\n\nBut make sure you look up about safety and being smart with potential scammers, etc.",0

"Question about Bitcoin So I've been aware of Bitcoin for a long time now but I've always been a sceptic, this is probably going to be downvoted or called FUD. This would be a great time to ""buy the dip"" according to many but I can't find good arguments to my question so I figured I'd ask here. \n\nHow is this different from a ponzi scheme? People can only make money from people paying more in the future so any money I'd make is from someone buying hoping someone else would pay more, right? Not only that but money also dissapear from costs of mining and taxes. So for people to make 1 million other people have to spend more than that. How will this ever possibly change? According to information I can find a small amount of wallets contain a majority of all the Bitcoin so it doesn't sound like it's a wealth distributor either. \n\nYeah yeah, OP is just posting FUD and wouldn't want to buy Bitcoin anyways. Sure, if nobody can give me a good answer to this I won't.","Doesn't make it ethical or a good case for Bitcoin. I'm afraid it might be a scam long term where either I or someone else loses all of their money, you saying that's ""in capitalism"" is not making a case for why Bitcoin wouldn't be different. I would want arguments as to why this wouldn't be the case because if it's the case then Bitcoin is just a global scam where every dollar or product made is made from someone else and then there's a huge money sink on taxes and mining.\n\nI guess the case could be argued (which people in the comment have argued for) that once it reaches the status of a ""true currency"" not bound by the dollar this won't be relevant but until then people are losing and gaining dollars (and other currencies and products) from Bitcoin with no good promise of this changing.",0

"how to choose a cryptocurrency to invest in. i started reading about cryptocurrency 3-4 months ago during the bull runs. i'm a non-programmer with no technical knowledge about coding. whenever i've tried to read about a project, i couldn't grasp anything of it is underlying technology. i want to invest in cryptocurrency as the basic idea looks promising, but i don't want to gamble blindly or invest just because of the hype. so my question is, does one really need to understand the technology to be an astute investor? if not, how should one evaluate a cryptocurrency without understanding it is technical jargon?","I personally think that you should at least understand fundamentals of cryptocurrency and blockchain. When it comes to stocks you probably wouldnt invest into a company you know nothing about.\n\nUnfortunately you'll have to spend a lot of time on learning and research if you want to become a successful investor. I'll try to help you get started.\n\nThere are a lot of great resources on youtube.\n\nI'd suggest you start with Blockchain. Watch a couple of videos on blockchain, learn how it works and why there is so much hype about it. You dont really need any coding knowledge in order to start.\n\nThe next step should be how cryptocurrency is built on blockchain and how cryptocurrency like Bitcoin works.\n\nAfter that you should have the basic understanding of this space you can build upon. There are a ton of different projects doing a ton of different things, but the fundamentals are always the same. From this point on its different for every project. You need to learn about the project and their goals. Its always useful to learn about the space they are trying to improve (for example DeFi is trying to replace traditional banking, etc.). Only when you understand previously mentioned things you can decide for yourself whether you believe a project has a chance of succeeding or not.\n\nI'd also recommend you dont spend too much time on charts and TA since this knowledge isnt really important when you're investing long term. Its far more important to understand how a single project could affect the world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is a saying you shouldnt forget about: ""Would you rather invest into a good project, or make money"". There are a ton of great projects that fail and a ton of bad projects that make average people rich. Do not take everything for granted and do not get discouraged if the project you invest in fails.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck on your journey!",0

But coin A has total supply of 5mil (so has released only 20% of its future supply) ... and coin B has a total future supply of 1mil (so has already released 100% of its future supply) ... in this situation coinB should be considered more valuable because it will have not have the pressures of future supply inflation putting downward pressure on its future price.",0

"is bitcoin is value solely based on the greater fool theory? disclaimer: i actually hold btc myself as an investment, but i'm really wondering what intrinsic value and use case bitcoin has.\njust to clarify, i do understand most of the technical details of bitcoin like mining, proof of work and the 21 million cap. \nthe greater fool theory is basically the idea that the price of an asset is determined by how much others are willing to pay for it. basically people buy something because they can sell it for more to a greater fool, who then hopes they can sell it to an even greater fool thus leading to the price continuing to grow as more and more people buy in. i'm sure we've all seen the likes of r/technology calling this ponzi/pyramid/mlm which isn't exactly what it is, but the idea is the same. \ni'm playing devil is advocate here, but what really sets btc apart from speculative bubbles like dutch tulips or beanie babies? as in why would you buy bitcoin other than hoping to sell it for more later? it was originally intended to be electronic cash but it obviously didn't go that route. \nif you say it is a store of value (which i understand why) it doesn't seem to hold stable value as of present, like precious metals do. will the price stabilise in the future or do we just hope it will?\nif you say the lack of barriers to easily transfer value anywhere in the world, there is plenty of much more efficient blockchain technologies that do it much better than btc.\nif you say decentralisation, that is not what the majority are buying btc for. they (including many of us) just want to make money. how much intrinsic value does it really provide?\njust to reiterate, i'm not against bitcoin. i am just wondering if anyone has some convincing counterarguments to these criticisms and a lot of others, instead of just saying the people who make these arguments are ignorant or uneducated (though some may be).\nif you have any other criticisms of btc feel free to share, and i would love to hear some rebuttals to other common claims made by the likes of r/technology.","There's no point in calling anything useful money, because why would you spend something useful?!",0

When bitcoin starts crashing and alts start pumping, itll be too late to ride the wave.\n\nBull market Tip 2: Dont listen to any coin price predictions from the news, clickbaity cringy youtube videos, or blog posts (that will surely be shared at the top page of this subreddit daily later this year when its ripe altcoin season). Almost 99% of them were far overestimates of what the true peak will be. In late 2017- early 2018, people were saying bitcoin would hit $200,000, ripple (xrp) would hit $10, cardano would hit $5, etc, etc. They want you to buy at the peak so they can sell off. Listen to your rational, logical thinking and not hopeful emotional thinking on when you should start taking profits.\n\nBull market Tip 3: Dont chase altcoins that have been pumping a lot. Chances are, the risk/reward ratio is stacked against you. \n\nBear market tip 1: About a year and a half after the peak when prices are flatlining, start buying back some cryptos for the next cycle. Safest to put it into bitcoin during a bear cycle. Even if an alt coin crashes 80% from the peak, some people miscalculate that they wont lose that much money since its already dropped so much. Until it drops 90% from the peak and youve effectively lost 50% more of your investment. \n\nBear market tip 2: this is all about accumulation. Learn about staking coins to earn some extra coins for the next bull cycle. If you stake $1000 in a coin at 5% apy at the bottom of the bear market, that $50 extra from staking can become $500 or even $1000 by itself when the next bull cycle comes",0

"when transferring coins between exchanges, use xlm to be able to move around with virtually no fees! just started doing this recently and realised i couldve saved myself hundreds in fees if i had begun to do this earlier. its especially great if youre constantly moving around smaller amounts between exchanges and youre a frequent buyer of smaller cap coins from exchanges like kucoin like me. ill list the fees/withdrawal limits to give everyone a practical idea of how it works\n\nminimum binance withdrawal for btc is currently 0.001 which is ~40. every transacation comes at a cost of 0.0005 btc which is ~20/$28, meaning if youre looking to withdraw around 200/$280 youre already around 10% down. over time if youre frequently looking to buy smaller coins not listed on major, this really starts to add up.\n\nsimilarly with eth, minimum withdrawal amount is 0.016 which is ~45/$63 with a fee of 0.005 on every transaction which is around 15/$21 every transaction, looking to withdraw 200/$280 there and youre down around 8%.\n\nlooking at xlm, minimum withdrawal amount is 40 which is ~16/$22 at current prices. a what really stands out though is the transaction fee, youre looking at an 0.02 fee every time which is less than 0.01! \n\nthe great thing about xlm is that its also available on the vast majority of exchanges, so converting it back after is super easy. there are other coins which work with the tiny fees, but in terms of availability they arent always listed across exchanges so xlm is the perfect middle ground.",I prefer EOS but +1 using this technique Everytime,0

"when transferring coins between exchanges, use xlm to be able to move around with virtually no fees! just started doing this recently and realised i couldve saved myself hundreds in fees if i had begun to do this earlier. its especially great if youre constantly moving around smaller amounts between exchanges and youre a frequent buyer of smaller cap coins from exchanges like kucoin like me. ill list the fees/withdrawal limits to give everyone a practical idea of how it works\n\nminimum binance withdrawal for btc is currently 0.001 which is ~40. every transacation comes at a cost of 0.0005 btc which is ~20/$28, meaning if youre looking to withdraw around 200/$280 youre already around 10% down. over time if youre frequently looking to buy smaller coins not listed on major, this really starts to add up.\n\nsimilarly with eth, minimum withdrawal amount is 0.016 which is ~45/$63 with a fee of 0.005 on every transaction which is around 15/$21 every transaction, looking to withdraw 200/$280 there and youre down around 8%.\n\nlooking at xlm, minimum withdrawal amount is 40 which is ~16/$22 at current prices. a what really stands out though is the transaction fee, youre looking at an 0.02 fee every time which is less than 0.01! \n\nthe great thing about xlm is that its also available on the vast majority of exchanges, so converting it back after is super easy. there are other coins which work with the tiny fees, but in terms of availability they arent always listed across exchanges so xlm is the perfect middle ground.",> $4000 in limbo\n\nJesus Christ man!

(you are god). based on that it is safer to say ""i invest in the top x coins"" instead of saying i only invest in coin x and coin y.\n2. investing in altcoins in addition to btc can increase your roi considerably. investing in top 7-10 coins tends to yield the most return in this case study (x3).\n3. based on #2, a crypto etf (or a similar service from exchanges that allow us to buy in bulk) could give exposure to the top x coins while saving transaction costs considerably.\n\nif you want more details, here is what your wallet would look like in each case of the above:\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ note:** this whole case study was a fun project and i was trying to answer some questions and thought to share it with you in case that would help you in any way. also it is important to not that history does not dictate the future, so please take all of what i present here with a grain of salt.\n\nmuch love!

"why bitcoin might fall? \n\ni've recently really got into crypto. however, there are some concerns about bitcoin that i have that i cant knock back.\n\n\nfirstly, i noticed that many believe that bitcoin could replace our financial system. my issue with this is that wouldn't there be issues in the allocation of money to people? with no central governance how would governments supply those who require benefits? how could they supply funds to new businesses or gov backed developments? wouldn't wealth stay firmly stuck with the few - a problem that admittedly still exists with normal money, but surely the problem is accentuated by bitcoin?\n\n\nsecondly, i've seen many arguments about the intrinsic value of bitcoin. realistically, from my understanding the tech for bitcoin is clunky compared to other cryptos, the limit of 7 transactions a second will surely hinder its use as a global currency? furthermore, as a store of wealth is it that favourable? gold for example is scarce and has real world use, electronics and fashion. unfortunately you can't wear a bitcoin.\n\n\ni do actually believe cryptos can be a store of wealth, but fundamentally they also need to have real utility so they have something to fall back onto. with bitcoin, surely the only incentive to own bitcoin at the moment is so you can sell it on to somebody else for the same amount or more money?\n\nwouldn't a coin like erg be a better store of value? it has real utility and is scarce and can be redistributed if not moved about after a certain time period ( preventing money being lost ). and yes lol, kind of a shameless plug bc i've invested in erg. but i'm more interested in what people think about my questions and if i'm correct in thinking that something like erg is actually a better store of wealth.\n\n","Havent heard of Erg, but yes BTC is basically just a value store. Maybe ETH or ADA would be better cause of the utility. But maybe XRP would also be a good public blockchain, cause of the transaction speed.

"My Plan for Crypto For Christmas I received a bit of money I can invest.  The majority I added to my savings for retirement ý traditional stocks and bonds.  But I also had a chunk I can add to my crypto portfolio.  Right now I have about 50% in large caps ý BTC and ETH.  About 30% in mid-cap and 20% in small-cap.   But when this money becomes available (after the week-long hold time for Coinbase), I am thinking of changing things a bit. I am bullish on crypto.  I see the recent decline in the market as an advantage for me because that means I can buy more coins/tokens for my money.   But I think that BTC and ETH are the most likely to weather the test of time.  So I am thinking about changing the way my investment is spread. I am toying with the numbers ý but Iým tempted to go with 50% BTC, 30% ETH, and then 14% in medium and 6% in small. Although bullish on crypto, I feel that the potential reward isnýt worth the high risk for these smaller coins/tokens.  Maybe I am getting too old.  :)","Basically, the lower you go on the ranks, the more you go towards gambling instead of ""safe"" investing.

So, so, so, SO MANY projects are dead, or about to die, only being kept ""alive"" by bagholders/shillers and traders.

newbie question: uniswap failed transaction i tried to use the uniswap platform and the native token uni to purchase mir from my coinbase wallet. the uniswap platform caculated the fees and i clicked to authorize the transaction. i was notified that the transaction failed because i ran out of gas and it charged me about $36 in gas reguardless. should i be adjusting the ammount of gas? $36 is a rediculous ammount to buy $200 usd of mir. what am i doing wrong?,"Hello r/CryptoCurrency readers.

"when transferring coins between exchanges, use xlm to be able to move around with virtually no fees! just started doing this recently and realised i couldve saved myself hundreds in fees if i had begun to do this earlier. its especially great if youre constantly moving around smaller amounts between exchanges and youre a frequent buyer of smaller cap coins from exchanges like kucoin like me. ill list the fees/withdrawal limits to give everyone a practical idea of how it works\n\nminimum binance withdrawal for btc is currently 0.001 which is ~40. every transacation comes at a cost of 0.0005 btc which is ~20/$28, meaning if youre looking to withdraw around 200/$280 youre already around 10% down. over time if youre frequently looking to buy smaller coins not listed on major, this really starts to add up.\n\nsimilarly with eth, minimum withdrawal amount is 0.016 which is ~45/$63 with a fee of 0.005 on every transaction which is around 15/$21 every transaction, looking to withdraw 200/$280 there and youre down around 8%.\n\nlooking at xlm, minimum withdrawal amount is 40 which is ~16/$22 at current prices. a what really stands out though is the transaction fee, youre looking at an 0.02 fee every time which is less than 0.01! \n\nthe great thing about xlm is that its also available on the vast majority of exchanges, so converting it back after is super easy. there are other coins which work with the tiny fees, but in terms of availability they arent always listed across exchanges so xlm is the perfect middle ground.","Lol, if ALGO reaches $10,000 a coin, I'd happily pay a $10 transaction fee.",0

"social skills 101 for crypto bros saw a question on askmen subreddit ""what is the male version of astrology girl?"" and to no one is surprise crypto dude is one of the top answers.\n\nlet is be real here, we people who are into crypto have a bad reputation socially. we are at best socially inept, at worst cult-like. the stereotype of the crypto bros is one who tries to 'teach' them about crypto, and get them to convert their hard earned money to the sacred crypto. i have been on dates and the moment i talk about crypto, i can literal feel her pants tighten up, and help her remember that she has something important came up and need to end the date early.\n\nto help with dispelling this negative image of crypto bros, i decided to write up this post on how to improve our social skills with people.\n\nthe fundamental issue with crypto bros is basing his entire identity around crypto itself. to be fair, basing one is identity to a single thing, like religion, politics, work etc. is a horrible idea. life is a lot more than just crypto; have some fun hobbies, be proactive in your professional career, be involved in friends and families' lives. i get that you're passionate about crypto and how it will change your life, that doesn't mean you have to shove it down into other people is throat. it is like that annoying christian dude that won't shut up about jesus and somehow connecting every conversational topic to him.\n\ni am not advocating for people to actively hide the fact that they're into crypto, if it comes out in a conversation, it comes out. there is a huge difference in responding to the question ""what are you into?"" with ""i'm really into my job (or ""working towards my dream job"" if you hate your job), i'm into (some hobby), and like to trade some crypto on the side."" vs ""oh i'm really into crypto!"" followed by a 1 hour lecture on crypto. what i'm saying is that it is important to be a well-rounded person and not basing your entire identity on crypto alone.\n\nan unhealthy mentality crypto bros have is what i call the 'red pill' mentality, where they feel superior just because they're into crypto and the person they're talking to isn't. this same mentality is also commonly found in cults, conspiracy nuts and anti-vaxxers.\n\nanother important thing, read their body language. if when talking about crypto and you can see they're no longer attentive like looking away or just looking dead in the eye, change the topic. this applies to any conversational topic. if they're not into what you're into, that is ok. if they're interested in crypto, naturally they'll ask you more about it.\n\nremember a social interaction is a two-way street, where you share about what you're into, they share theirs, and establishing commonalities. it is not you shoving down your isuperior' crypto ways into their throats.",Are you a meme?

(converting to stablecoins) hello,\n\ni'm a complete newbie.\n\nhere is a plan i'm totally not the first one to think about with an example: these past days bitcoin keeps going from 25k to 35k, back and forth.\n\nwhat prevents me from buying bitcoins at 25k, let it go up to 35k, convert it all to some stablecoin like tether, wait for it to go back to 25k, and rinse and repeat? is it something unrealistic? what is the flaw here?\n\ni'm asking this because it seems like a good idea but also complete bullshit, so i'm definitely missing something. i want to understand why this doesn't work (or else many people would've already done it i guess).","Nothing prevents you from doing it. Problem is it's a lot harder than it looks. \n\nIt looks easy because you're looking at past data and seeing it as if you're seeing the future. The future is unknown. You can do technical analysis and try to time the market.\n\nMost fail. Even if you succeed it's at what cost? Staring at the computer 10 hrs a day? No sleep or exercise?

Bought some KSM locked it in and got MOVR as reward. I was able to redeem around 40% on day one when Moonriver launched and I have to force-hold the rest of my reward because they are locked in the contract for now. Made around 330% profit but technically it's free money because the Kusama I've invested during the ICO/lending parachain auction process will be given back to me in 48 weeks. So literally it cost me $0. Of course KSM can be worth much less in 48 weeks if this bull run ends next year but I guess I'll just hold my KSM and sell it during next bull run. Or use it for another parachain auction for another project. Even if KSM goes to $0 I'll still make around 200% profit so yeah not too bad I guess.,0

what coins do you feel are currently the most undervalued and have the most potential to increase over say a 5 year period? this came up during a discussion of crypto this weekend and nearly everyone i was talking to had a completely different answer. interested to hear what reddit thinks. if you can provide any reasoning for your answer(s) that would be good too. thanks for any input.,"It doesn't necessarily need a stable price to function as a payment system since everything is pretty much transacted in terms of fiat value right now. So one person would prob buy Nano, send it, the other receiving party would hold it or sell it for fiat. In terms of the cost of the product being exchanged, it'll be calculated in fiat value in realtime. This is probably the case for any product being bought and sold with cryptocurrency. \nUsing it to pay for things also doesn't mean no hodling because someone is receiving Nano anyway and if they choose to keep the Nano instead of exchanging for fiat, the market cap of Nano would rise. Even if they sell Nano for fiat, it'll just negate the buyer's impact on the overall marketcap. As long as there's increasing value being transacted on the network, the value of the cryptocurrency would rise over time. \n\nNano holders are banking on its tech of feeless instant transactions. Ultimately, the only thing that'll drive real Nano value is adoption. Whether that will actually happen remains to be seen. I think right now, people aren't even buying bitcoin for small transactions, they're just using it as a store of value/hedge against inflation/speculating investment and that works because when you ask people if they know of cryptocurrency, they'd more likely say Bitcoin. I find it unlikely that the regular person would know what Nano is. Currently, I'm of the belief that adoption isn't gonna happen. Because there isn't any incentive right now for regular people to use Nano over fiat. That could change if there's ever a future where we abandon fiat. (I personally don't think governments will ever let that happen)\n\nFor the record, I don't own any Nano. I'm admittedly just tired of Nano shills and Nano haters. No one can predict if something will be valuable or not. It is just what it is.",0
"when transferring coins between exchanges, use xlm to be able to move around with virtually no fees! just started doing this recently and realised i couldve saved myself hundreds in fees if i had begun to do this earlier. its especially great if youre constantly moving around smaller amounts between exchanges and youre a frequent buyer of smaller cap coins from exchanges like kucoin like me. ill list the fees/withdrawal limits to give everyone a practical idea of how it works\n\nminimum binance withdrawal for btc is currently 0.001 which is ~40. every transacation comes at a cost of 0.0005 btc which is ~20/$28, meaning if youre looking to withdraw around 200/$280 youre already around 10% down. over time if youre frequently looking to buy smaller coins not listed on major, this really starts to add up.\n\nsimilarly with eth, minimum withdrawal amount is 0.016 which is ~45/$63 with a fee of 0.005 on every transaction which is around 15/$21 every transaction, looking to withdraw 200/$280 there and youre down around 8%.\n\nlooking at xlm, minimum withdrawal amount is 40 which is ~16/$22 at current prices. a what really stands out though is the transaction fee, youre looking at an 0.02 fee every time which is less than 0.01! \n\nthe great thing about xlm is that its also available on the vast majority of exchanges, so converting it back after is super easy. there are other coins which work with the tiny fees, but in terms of availability they arent always listed across exchanges so xlm is the perfect middle ground.","I don't think the spam attacks will last much longer.

"Scammed yesterday, need help getting support from Cybercrime Division.hello people, just before Ethereum Merge, there were many scams running and I fell for one. I am a dickhead and thought that I was immune to such bullshit. In my case the guy was impersonating Vitalik - founder of Ethereum. He posted a fake giveaway on Twitter id u/Zidwait saying that he will give 2x Ethereum back to people who deposit ETH in his wallet. This was also the top result in Google Search as well for the whole day. \n\nHe had linked a site - [www.ethereum-celebration.com](https://www.ethereum-celebration.com) where he had shared his wallet address - **0x346b289363a057387d0d6b8b568abfbc82a8b0a6** where ETH had to be deposited. I deposited around 0.428 ETH and obviously didn't get anything back as I had fallen for a scam foolishly. \n\nI instantly reported this to Binance customer support, and they told me that they could only help me if the scammer had his wallet with Binance only, otherwise they couldn't do anything and told me to report to local law enforcement. I have already made a detailed report on [cybercrime.gov.in](https://cybercrime.gov.in) website portal with screenshots and all but I haven't got any response. I even tried to call their helpline number today, but no one picked the call. \n\nNow I did my own research the whole day and was able to track the scammer's transactions to a Binance wallet which I reported to Binance few hours back. They have told me that they have frozen his account, but **they cannot block it permanently and they need a request from a law enforcement to block his account** and get my money back. I provided them with below proof - \n\nthis is the wallet (#1) address they were using to get eth deposited - [https://etherscan.io/address/0x346b289363a057387d0d6b8b568abfbc82a8b0a6](https://etherscan.io/address/0x346b289363a057387d0d6b8b568abfbc82a8b0a6) . Check the 2nd and 3rd transactions to their new Wallet (#2) - **0xd1b7cca582578bff37faab547a4d50ff6342c6d0**. He obviously reroutes the stolen ETH across various wallets. Now see this transaction from wallet #2 to another new wallet (#3) - **0xFAA9C6676473D049FAe82D8277d1f53028FF76Ae**. Then, as can be seen @ [https://etherscan.io/address/0xfaa9c6676473d049fae82d8277d1f53028ff76ae](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfaa9c6676473d049fae82d8277d1f53028ff76ae) , he transfers all the stolen ETH from wallet #3 into his Binance wallet. As you can see this wallet is only used to transfer funds into Binance. There are no other outgoing transactions. \n\nFor anyone still not convinced, follow a few transactions at this link -  [Address 0xab6db7eb524e2d06c5209e21e68ba02dc501f912 | Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xab6db7eb524e2d06c5209e21e68ba02dc501f912) \n\nI have some other proofs for his other wallets as well, but this was the easiest to explain. From his other wallets that I saw, this person seems to have scammed to tune of almost hundreds of thousands of dollars. This is what Binance is seeking -  \n\n'*An official Law Enforcement request raised by a police officer through the following link* [*https://www.binance.com/en/support/law-enforcement*](https://www.binance.com/en/support/law-enforcement) *from an official email address and attaching the following:*\n\n*A. The photo, name, mailbox, and telephone contact of the investigating officer. B. It is necessary to issue an official document of assistance with an official seal, C. The letter should specify what information Binance needs to provide to cooperate with the investigation (such as providing account information corresponding to the 0xfaa9c6676473d049fae82d8277d1f53028ff76ae address and other involved addresses, real name information, phone number, etc.)'*\n\nNow, the issue is that I didn't get any support from Cybercrime portal. After researching the shit out of everything and talking with Binance support till late evening, I went to local cybercrime cell (*which I was not even sure if it existed in first place. I live in a Tier 3 city*) and they told me to go to State Cyber cell tomorrow morning. But from their google reviews I am pretty sure I won't get much help there either. I have also reported this on Interpol's website as Binance support executive recommended. Now what should I do? Where do I get any support?",[deleted],0

"why were my coins sold at a lower price than the stop-loss order i entered? hello. this thing happened a month ago, but i wanted to ask anyway. \n\non the morning of september 21, i opened a long trade at $18900 on bitcoin. as i predicted, bitcoin is price started to rise towards the time of the fed meeting. i'm not a person who uses stop-loss a lot, but since everyone i see said 'don't forget to use it', i set a stop-loss order at 19.200$ just in case. \n\nafter the interest rate was announced at the fed meeting, as you know, within seconds, bitcoin first went up to 20.000$ and then suddenly started to fall. my stop-loss order didn't work at 19,200$ and it automatically closed the position at 18.400$, almost the lowest point where bitcoin fell.\n\nin this case, i made a loss because of stop-loss. if stop-loss doesn't work on sudden drops, then why we should use it? if the order had never worked, i would still understand it. however, the fact that it worked at a level far below the stop-loss order i gave, that is a huge problem.","There are market orders and limit orders.  A market order gets execution at the next available price (market price).  A limit order gets execution at the limit price or better, but execution is not guaranteed.  A stop loss order trigers a market order at your stop price.  So at $19,200 a market order was sent and you got the next available price.  In rapidly declining markets the price you get can be a lot lower than the stop price.  There is also something called stop limit orders.  You set a stop price and a limit price.  When the price hits your stop it sends a limit order at your limit price.  The risk of a stop limit is that if the price is is declining fast it may drop below your limit before it can execute in which case no sale will occur.  (Limit orders are not guaranteed execution).",1
"which is better: buying top coins vs. buying btc &amp; eth - (a 6 years dca case study) inspired by [this post]( i built a script to analyse if you dca'd blindly in the top crypto coins vs. investing in btc &amp; eth vs investing only in btc since the beginning of 2015, how much would your total worth is. here are the results.\n\n**numbers &amp; assumptions:**\n\n* dcaing takes place every week, on 1st, 8th, 15th and 22th of every month starting from jan 1st 2015 and until july 6th 2021.\n* investments budget per week is $100.\n* the weekly investment is divided equally on the coins invested in.\n* this case study is ignoring stable coin investments. e.g.: investing in the top 5 coins means the top 5 coins excluding any stable coins.\n* the analysis is assuming that you invested your money and never sold any coin till now.\n* total invested money over the whole dca period is $31,300.\n* transaction fees are not included in the analysis.\n\n**here are the results:**\n\n* if you blindly dca into the top 1 coins (btc), you will end up with **$1,102,104**.\n* if you blindly dca into the top 2 coins, you will end up with 4 coins (btc, xrp, ltc, eth) in your wallet and total worth of **$1,462,443**.\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 3 coins**, you will end up with 11 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,310,552.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 5 coins**, you will end up with 23 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,490,189.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 7 coins**, you will end up with 37 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,923,849.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 10 coins**, you will end up with 55 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,316,169.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 20 coins**, you will end up with 130 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,619,756.**\n* if you blindly dca into the **top 50 coins**, you will end up with 381 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$979,086.**\n* if you had a glass ball and knew that eth will be what it is today and you invested only in btc &amp; eth, you will end up with 2 coins in your wallet (surprise), and a total worth of **$4,505,477.**\n\n**some observations:**\n\n1. although it was relatively easier to guess that btc will be the #1 crypto coin back then, nobody would have guessed for sure that eth will be #2, so betting on btc &amp; eth only from the beginning would've been your strategy only if you know the future. (you are god). based on that it is safer to say ""i invest in the top x coins"" instead of saying i only invest in coin x and coin y.\n2. investing in altcoins in addition to btc can increase your roi considerably. investing in top 7-10 coins tends to yield the most return in this case study (x3).\n3. based on #2, a crypto etf (or a similar service from exchanges that allow us to buy in bulk) could give exposure to the top x coins while saving transaction costs considerably.\n\nif you want more details, here is what your wallet would look like in each case of the above:\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ note:** this whole case study was a fun project and i was trying to answer some questions and thought to share it with you in case that would help you in any way. also it is important to not that history does not dictate the future, so please take all of what i present here with a grain of salt.\n\nmuch love!

"when transferring coins between exchanges, use xlm to be able to move around with virtually no fees! just started doing this recently and realised i couldve saved myself hundreds in fees if i had begun to do this earlier. its especially great if youre constantly moving around smaller amounts between exchanges and youre a frequent buyer of smaller cap coins from exchanges like kucoin like me. ill list the fees/withdrawal limits to give everyone a practical idea of how it works\n\nminimum binance withdrawal for btc is currently 0.001 which is ~40. every transacation comes at a cost of 0.0005 btc which is ~20/$28, meaning if youre looking to withdraw around 200/$280 youre already around 10% down. over time if youre frequently looking to buy smaller coins not listed on major, this really starts to add up.\n\nsimilarly with eth, minimum withdrawal amount is 0.016 which is ~45/$63 with a fee of 0.005 on every transaction which is around 15/$21 every transaction, looking to withdraw 200/$280 there and youre down around 8%.\n\nlooking at xlm, minimum withdrawal amount is 40 which is ~16/$22 at current prices. a what really stands out though is the transaction fee, youre looking at an 0.02 fee every time which is less than 0.01! \n\nthe great thing about xlm is that its also available on the vast majority of exchanges, so converting it back after is super easy. there are other coins which work with the tiny fees, but in terms of availability they arent always listed across exchanges so xlm is the perfect middle ground.","Also, use the Stellar DEX and trade right from your hardware wallet.",0

This means that if the coins hypothetically were to end up equally valued at this moment, you'd see 15x growth of ALGO versus ADA. Let's take into account ALGO and ADA's tokenomics over time: Since about 31% of total ALGO supply and 71% of ADA total has been released, the price for 1 ALGO would grow 6.55x compared to ADA if they gain the same market cap, if my math checks out.That being said, I still hold both although more ALGO than ADA for pretty much the precise reason above. Imo ALGO seems relatively undervalued when looking at how much discussion and attention it's been gathering, even given the remaining distribution of ALGO that is to come.  \nThis also means if you think ADA will end up with double the valuation of ALGO, ALGO growth would end up 3.275x ADA's price growth.  \n\n\nPlease correct me if there's something I'm missing, but basically the worries about downward price pressure by distribution of new ALGO seem to be a bit overplayed at the moment in the price.",0

In some cases, the team is more important than the coin itself. Take ADA for example..they are on their way to an extraordinary future, but the coin does hardly a damn thing at the moment. Without the insane trust in founder Hosky and his willingness to be incredibly detailed and transparent about what the project is doing, the coin wouldn't be worth near what it is now and will be in the coming months. You seem to be on the right track! I'm a new investor as of 2021 as well and wish you the best of luck my friend!  \nOhh yea, and have an exit strategy!!! Don't expect to be able to time the market time because the chances are not in your favor. Instead, DCA out of your position once you think we are nearing the top of the market, selling off little by little until you are comfortable with your gains.  \nAnd another another thing...taxes are a nightmare so keep up with your transactions. I make a note of every crypto transaction I make with the price, currency conversion, date, and exchange name just to be safe. Be sure to calculate any short term gains and put the proper amount back for taxes. I've seen way to many stories about people having to sell off massively profitable coins to cover taxes they didn't see coming!   \nLastly....do your own research.

"Why can't Indian banks let me invest in crypto when RBI has no problem with it? Just like most Indian banks, HDFC Bank has blacklisted crypto transactions through online payment methods.

How do i know that it was my bank and not the merchant? I talked to the customer support of all merchants I tried and they all said it was the bank(I saw the decline code).

The whole crypto market is getting manipulated by coordinated whale attacks for example, bigger projects can sustain because of higher volume. \nSmaller ones suffer heavily. MAP on Dot for example, most low mc coins and mid mc coins suffer heavily through that. But furthermore I talked about a different issue as well, there are projects that have marketing budgets in their native coins, if they want to do marketing or get money for listings, they are forced to crush their own price in hope of finding support levels later on. \n\nThe use cases are clear, for once being able to switch to coins with a higher volume to not devalue the own coins as well when you are in need of money.

(you are god). based on that it is safer to say ""i invest in the top x coins"" instead of saying i only invest in coin x and coin y.\n2. investing in altcoins in addition to btc can increase your roi considerably. investing in top 7-10 coins tends to yield the most return in this case study (x3).\n3. based on #2, a crypto etf (or a similar service from exchanges that allow us to buy in bulk) could give exposure to the top x coins while saving transaction costs considerably.\n\nif you want more details, here is what your wallet would look like in each case of the above:\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ note:** this whole case study was a fun project and i was trying to answer some questions and thought to share it with you in case that would help you in any way. also it is important to not that history does not dictate the future, so please take all of what i present here with a grain of salt.\n\nmuch love!

(you are god). based on that it is safer to say ""i invest in the top x coins"" instead of saying i only invest in coin x and coin y.\n2. investing in altcoins in addition to btc can increase your roi considerably. investing in top 7-10 coins tends to yield the most return in this case study (x3).\n3. based on #2, a crypto etf (or a similar service from exchanges that allow us to buy in bulk) could give exposure to the top x coins while saving transaction costs considerably.\n\nif you want more details, here is what your wallet would look like in each case of the above:\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ note:** this whole case study was a fun project and i was trying to answer some questions and thought to share it with you in case that would help you in any way. also it is important to not that history does not dictate the future, so please take all of what i present here with a grain of salt.\n\nmuch love!

Binance says you get ETH back 1:1 after those 2 years (excluding rewards because you already got them). But the rate ETH:BETH is about 0.93.

"explain nfts and crypto to me like im a child? good morning ladies and gentlemen!\nim still fairly new to crypto in general and i just want a basic rundown of nfts. everything ive seen online just confuses me more. i dont particularly understand the concept of nfts, why they are valuable, what the point is, and if they are even worth investing in. like, arent you just paying to own nothing? and i suppose buying crypto is the same as owning nothing but like i said, im fairly new. \n\nif you wouldnt mind, explain the basics of why its good to invest in crypto long term, and what nfts are and if theres any good reason to invest in them.","Nope, the other way around. You don't have to trust them, you can verify they did the right thing, it's completely trust-less. If I wanted to change a certificate stored in the blockchain so I'm the owner, I can't do that, because the other 999 people that are part of the blockchain realise my change is invalid.\n\nWhat makes you say startups are not trustworthy? A startup is nothing more than a newly started company trying to bring their innovative product to the market. Ofcourse, you'll have to investigate their product, the usecase, the problem it solves, the added value it provides. But that's true regardless of the startup using crypto/blockchain or not. Whether or not it's worth investing in is what you have to decide for yourself.\n\nTake these 2 examples, in a nutshell:\n\nDOGE: A cryptocurrency based on an internet meme. It provides fast transfer of DOGE currency. The added value is that it might be faster than cross-continent money transfer, and that it's got a dog meme connected to it.\n\nGET Protocol: GET Protocol is a ticketing protocol. It provides a way for companies to sell fully digital tickets. It uses blockchain to solve ticket scalping and lack of insight in 2nd hand resales. The added value is anti-scalping & more insight in customers.\n\nWhich one sounds like a good investment and which one doesn't? To me GET sounds great, DOGE sounds like a dead end. However, others might believe the meme part will bring it further, and that ticketing is such a niche business that GET won't exist in 2 years.\n\nYou'll have to investigate the projects where you might want to invest in. Crypto itself is NOT inherently more or less risky than normal stock options.",0

Various attempts have been made to eliminate the need for centralized entities controlling the flow of location data, but every attempt has relied on the integrity of the devices col- lecting this data in the physical world. We propose a trustless, cryptographic location network using a novel formulation reliant on a chain of zero-knowledge proofs to establish a high  degree of data certainty on location information. The XYO Network (XY Oracle Network) is an abstraction that enables layered, location verification across many device classes and protocols. At its core sits a set of novel cryptographic mechanisms known as Proof of Origin & Bound Witness that tie together the power of blockchain technology and real world data collection into a system with direct applications today.",0

What's the cheapest way to convert INR to USDT?I am looking for the best way to convert INR to a stablecoin so that I can buy other cryptos with it. Currently I use Binance P2P where I get around 9400/- worth of USDT for 10000/- INR.\n\nIs there a more efficient way than this?

"isn't cross-chain compatibility the future? then why are interoperability coins so undervalued? it seems that every blockchain is doing its own thing, trying to dominate nfts, defi or consolidate value only to its own coin or token, but that is not the way of the future. \n\nright now the the major challenge that blockchain technology is facing is the lack of interoperability, or the lack of cross-chain compatibility. \n\nthe projects that are working hard to address those issues--the biggest names out there would be polkadot (dot), cosmos (atom) and chainlink (link)--are severely undervalued imho compared to other chains out there. \n\neach blockchain project has different characteristics that prevent them from communicating with eachother, unconnected to other chains, preventing it from reaching its true potential of interconnectedness; which would allow integration with existing systems, being able to initiate transactions on other networks and conducting interchain transactions with much lower gas fees. \n\nif interoperability is the game-changer for the blockchain industry and the key to mass adoption, then why are all of these projects so severely undervalued? that is my question.","I mean, sure. Holding a coin for yields is a viable use case but that's probably the \*minimal\* use case in this space. It'll have to compete with the yields of so many more coins, and not just staking yields but defi as well--unless it's at 30-40% APY consistently, the demand won't be high at all.\n\nThe main use case AFAIK is governance, which isn't really enticing unless you have a significant of stake in the direction of the network. And, even then, governance typically does not yield significant demands.\n\nCompare this to an in-demand L1 like Ethereum, where you \*NEED\* to buy ETH to participate in the network in order to pay for gas. Granted, the demand of NFTs, where millions of $ in value is transferred everyday; the buying pressure is high for ETH.\n\nThe same can be said for other L1s that require a native token to participate like AVAX, LUNA, FTM, and SOL. If you look at the growth of their ecosystems, the price action isn't surprising. Their price action is directly correlated to the growth of their respective ecosystems. Again, this is because there is a \*NEED\* to buy the native token, whereas Cosmos can be used without ATOM.\n\nCosmos is definitely here to stay. So many bullish things are built on it. Thorchain is also one of the most bullish dexes in the space (if successful), and that's built on Cosmos. But ATOM is different. ATOM is entirely optional--especially for retail.\n\nEdit: LUNA is even more interesting because its value is inherently tied to the value of it's algorithmic stablecoin, UST. Also, slight correction, you don't necessarily have to use LUNA to use the Terra Luna chain.",0

(you are god). based on that it is safer to say ""i invest in the top x coins"" instead of saying i only invest in coin x and coin y.\n2. investing in altcoins in addition to btc can increase your roi considerably. investing in top 7-10 coins tends to yield the most return in this case study (x3).\n3. based on #2, a crypto etf (or a similar service from exchanges that allow us to buy in bulk) could give exposure to the top x coins while saving transaction costs considerably.\n\nif you want more details, here is what your wallet would look like in each case of the above:\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ note:** this whole case study was a fun project and i was trying to answer some questions and thought to share it with you in case that would help you in any way. also it is important to not that history does not dictate the future, so please take all of what i present here with a grain of salt.\n\nmuch love!

(you are god). based on that it is safer to say ""i invest in the top x coins"" instead of saying i only invest in coin x and coin y.\n2. investing in altcoins in addition to btc can increase your roi considerably. investing in top 7-10 coins tends to yield the most return in this case study (x3).\n3. based on #2, a crypto etf (or a similar service from exchanges that allow us to buy in bulk) could give exposure to the top x coins while saving transaction costs considerably.\n\nif you want more details, here is what your wallet would look like in each case of the above:\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ note:** this whole case study was a fun project and i was trying to answer some questions and thought to share it with you in case that would help you in any way. also it is important to not that history does not dictate the future, so please take all of what i present here with a grain of salt.\n\nmuch love!

"Why can't Indian banks let me invest in crypto when RBI has no problem with it? Just like most Indian banks, HDFC Bank has blacklisted crypto transactions through online payment methods. When all my HDFC cards got declined by the bank, I called the bank to whitelist the sites I'm attempting to trade on. They lied that it is ""the merchant"" who declined my transactions and not the bank.\n\nI knew they were lying so I performed test transactions on major crypto exchanges through multiple HDFC cards and all were declined by the bank. How do i know that it was my bank and not the merchant? I talked to the customer support of all merchants I tried and they all said it was the bank(I saw the decline code). The fact that transactions get declined post successful ""OTP"" verification proves that the bank has implemented a system to block all crypto transactions in the final stage of the transaction cycle even if they passed all the transaction requirements(having funds, passing OTP verification, etc).\n\nThe bank then froze all my cards for a couple of days with no communication at all.

"when transferring coins between exchanges, use xlm to be able to move around with virtually no fees! just started doing this recently and realised i couldve saved myself hundreds in fees if i had begun to do this earlier. its especially great if youre constantly moving around smaller amounts between exchanges and youre a frequent buyer of smaller cap coins from exchanges like kucoin like me. ill list the fees/withdrawal limits to give everyone a practical idea of how it works\n\nminimum binance withdrawal for btc is currently 0.001 which is ~40. every transacation comes at a cost of 0.0005 btc which is ~20/$28, meaning if youre looking to withdraw around 200/$280 youre already around 10% down. over time if youre frequently looking to buy smaller coins not listed on major, this really starts to add up.\n\nsimilarly with eth, minimum withdrawal amount is 0.016 which is ~45/$63 with a fee of 0.005 on every transaction which is around 15/$21 every transaction, looking to withdraw 200/$280 there and youre down around 8%.\n\nlooking at xlm, minimum withdrawal amount is 40 which is ~16/$22 at current prices. a what really stands out though is the transaction fee, youre looking at an 0.02 fee every time which is less than 0.01! \n\nthe great thing about xlm is that its also available on the vast majority of exchanges, so converting it back after is super easy. there are other coins which work with the tiny fees, but in terms of availability they arent always listed across exchanges so xlm is the perfect middle ground.","Depending on your country of residence.

I'm not an expert.\n\n1- Only invest what you can afford to lose.\n\n2- Only invest what you can afford to lose.\n\n3- ***ONLY INVEST WHAT YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE***. I prefer to repeat it a few too many times\n\n4- Don't discuss your crypto investments with people around you. Don't encourage people around you to invest either. Keep your crypto business strictly private. My mother, my sister, my best friend, none of them knows about my crypto. I'll tell them the day I cash out.\n\n4- When you buy, it's better to apply a DCA strategy\n\n5- Unless you really, really know what you're doing, I would advise staying away from automated bots\n\n6- Did I mention: ""only invest what you can afford to lose"" yet? Please, please please follow this rule religiously. You don't want to be one of those people who recently posted shit like ""I threw all my life savings at this coin and it crashed. I'm ruined. Suicide is my only option."". You chose a good moment to get in, but don't get tempted to use money you can't afford to lose.\n\n7- Personal advice but not shared by everyone: if you don't know too much about crypto in general, stick to the blue chip coins. Most of your portfolio should be those. In my case, about 80-85% of my portfolio is BTC and ETH.\n\n8- Also personal preference but don't get tempted by shitty meme coins. Do your own research about a new project before throwing money at it. If you don't know how to do proper own research, then don't risk it and stay away from coins you hesitate about\n\n9- Don't *ever* take a loan to buy crypto. Just don't. You also don't want to be one of those guys who recently posted ""I'm now in debt 200k with my bank because I loaned money to buy crypto and it's worth nothing now after the crash. I want to end my own life"". I've seen posts like this during this crash and during the 2018 crash. You do not want to be one of those.\n\n10- Beware of scammers. If someone DM's you about your crypto investments, it's a scammer. If you get phone calls from people offering you crypto services, it's a scammer. If you get phone calls from a famous exchange, it's a scammer. If you receive emails from unknown people about crypto, it's a scammer. Be very careful and never, ever give your keys or passwords to anyone.\n\n11- Take everything that crypto Youtubers say with a really enormous bag of salt. And if you see videos from a guy called Bitboy Crypto, ignore entirely as this guy is a huge cunt and gives really shitty advice.",0

(you are god). based on that it is safer to say ""i invest in the top x coins"" instead of saying i only invest in coin x and coin y.\n2. investing in altcoins in addition to btc can increase your roi considerably. investing in top 7-10 coins tends to yield the most return in this case study (x3).\n3. based on #2, a crypto etf (or a similar service from exchanges that allow us to buy in bulk) could give exposure to the top x coins while saving transaction costs considerably.\n\nif you want more details, here is what your wallet would look like in each case of the above:\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ note:** this whole case study was a fun project and i was trying to answer some questions and thought to share it with you in case that would help you in any way. also it is important to not that history does not dictate the future, so please take all of what i present here with a grain of salt.\n\nmuch love!

"social skills 101 for crypto bros saw a question on askmen subreddit ""what is the male version of astrology girl?"" and to no one is surprise crypto dude is one of the top answers.\n\nlet is be real here, we people who are into crypto have a bad reputation socially. we are at best socially inept, at worst cult-like. the stereotype of the crypto bros is one who tries to 'teach' them about crypto, and get them to convert their hard earned money to the sacred crypto. i have been on dates and the moment i talk about crypto, i can literal feel her pants tighten up, and help her remember that she has something important came up and need to end the date early.\n\nto help with dispelling this negative image of crypto bros, i decided to write up this post on how to improve our social skills with people.\n\nthe fundamental issue with crypto bros is basing his entire identity around crypto itself. to be fair, basing one is identity to a single thing, like religion, politics, work etc. is a horrible idea. life is a lot more than just crypto; have some fun hobbies, be proactive in your professional career, be involved in friends and families' lives. i get that you're passionate about crypto and how it will change your life, that doesn't mean you have to shove it down into other people is throat. it is like that annoying christian dude that won't shut up about jesus and somehow connecting every conversational topic to him.\n\ni am not advocating for people to actively hide the fact that they're into crypto, if it comes out in a conversation, it comes out. there is a huge difference in responding to the question ""what are you into?"" with ""i'm really into my job (or ""working towards my dream job"" if you hate your job), i'm into (some hobby), and like to trade some crypto on the side."" vs ""oh i'm really into crypto!"" followed by a 1 hour lecture on crypto. what i'm saying is that it is important to be a well-rounded person and not basing your entire identity on crypto alone.\n\nan unhealthy mentality crypto bros have is what i call the 'red pill' mentality, where they feel superior just because they're into crypto and the person they're talking to isn't. this same mentality is also commonly found in cults, conspiracy nuts and anti-vaxxers.\n\nanother important thing, read their body language. if when talking about crypto and you can see they're no longer attentive like looking away or just looking dead in the eye, change the topic. this applies to any conversational topic. if they're not into what you're into, that is ok. if they're interested in crypto, naturally they'll ask you more about it.\n\nremember a social interaction is a two-way street, where you share about what you're into, they share theirs, and establishing commonalities. it is not you shoving down your isuperior' crypto ways into their throats.",Then next thing you tell me that crypto questions are not cool on first date,0

(you are god). based on that it is safer to say ""i invest in the top x coins"" instead of saying i only invest in coin x and coin y.\n2. investing in altcoins in addition to btc can increase your roi considerably. investing in top 7-10 coins tends to yield the most return in this case study (x3).\n3. based on #2, a crypto etf (or a similar service from exchanges that allow us to buy in bulk) could give exposure to the top x coins while saving transaction costs considerably.\n\nif you want more details, here is what your wallet would look like in each case of the above:\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ note:** this whole case study was a fun project and i was trying to answer some questions and thought to share it with you in case that would help you in any way. also it is important to not that history does not dictate the future, so please take all of what i present here with a grain of salt.\n\nmuch love!

Creating a parachain is much more complicated than creating a token on an existing blockchain. You can create a Safemoon equivalent by just copy/pasting the code and changing the name. The reason is Safemoon is just a token on an already existing blockchain (BSC), and creating a token is thousands of times easier than building a blockchain, it's not even comparable. I'm assuming Safemoon also copy/pasted their token from somewhere else and the rest is 99% fake marketing. In order to create a parachain you'd need some serious development expertise and a product that already works on some testnet, without that you won't even be able to participate in the auction. This makes it extremely expensive both in money/time wise for anyone to even try pulling a scam.\n2. This might not be the case, but I'm assuming the parachains who won a slot in Kusama will be the same to win a slot in Polkadot, Kusama is meant to be like a beta version of Polkadot, where every parachain would battle test its features before moving them to Polkadot. This also means that if there was any project that was a scam we'd know way before the parachain auctions on Polkadot.\n3. The DOT that are locked won't even be accessible by the teams, they belong to the respective owners of the tokens, so anyone trying to pull a scam would actually gain nothing besides some advertisement of their project, but from the points I mentioned above I think it won't even be possible to reach the auctions with something that is a scam\n4. Each project in the ecosystem is interoperable with other existing projects, the teams in each project communicate with each other and try to make them work together. For example, Karura is a DEX exchange where you can add liquidity with different pairs (like Uniswap). Recently they had a proposal from the Moonbeam/Moonriver team to add their token MOVR to the Karura DEX. In other words, if there was a scam project going around it will be sniffed out 10000 miles away from the other teams in the ecosystem.\n\nHope this makes sense!  \nedit: added couple of more points",0

"isn't cross-chain compatibility the future? then why are interoperability coins so undervalued? it seems that every blockchain is doing its own thing, trying to dominate nfts, defi or consolidate value only to its own coin or token, but that is not the way of the future. \n\nright now the the major challenge that blockchain technology is facing is the lack of interoperability, or the lack of cross-chain compatibility. \n\nthe projects that are working hard to address those issues--the biggest names out there would be polkadot (dot), cosmos (atom) and chainlink (link)--are severely undervalued imho compared to other chains out there. \n\neach blockchain project has different characteristics that prevent them from communicating with eachother, unconnected to other chains, preventing it from reaching its true potential of interconnectedness; which would allow integration with existing systems, being able to initiate transactions on other networks and conducting interchain transactions with much lower gas fees. \n\nif interoperability is the game-changer for the blockchain industry and the key to mass adoption, then why are all of these projects so severely undervalued? that is my question.","Add a bit of ATOM too, it would be perfect",0

"does it matter how often you dca? tldr: should you dca monthly or every three months with a larger sum?\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\ni have been reading about crypto for years but i only started investing a year ago in august 2021.\n\nas you might expect at the beginning it was pretty much just random coins that were popular at that point. as i started learning more (and there is still so much i don't know) i started thinking at a portfolio allocation that would make sense to me and also an amount of money i could invest monthly.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nbut the challenge right now is that i am not sure if it makes sense to invest a couple hundred dollars monthly or wait and invest around 1,000$ every three months. especially from the perspective of trading fees and moving my coins from the exchange to my wallet afterwards.\n\nso i would appreciate some outside perspective on this.","Ahh, a fellow academic",0
"do you guys actually use or would use crypto as a form of payment right now? (if there was a wider use in public) i personally see crypto as a form of investment and not as a currency tbh. not yet atleast.\ni truly believe crypto is going to be the future but i just cant imagine, even in the near future to use a extremely volatile crypto as a form of payment. \n\nlike lets say the price of a pizza i could buy today is 0.0002 btc = 10.\nbut since btc is so volatile that price of 10 for a pizza must be updated like every minute and that just sounds kinda confusing and complicated because the 0.0002 btc tomorrow could be worth 12.\n\nand even if there was a wider use in the public (stores, restaurants etc.) i personally wouldnt use my bitcoin as payment as of now. \ni did order something for 50 bucks off the internet around september and used bitcoin as a payment. if i would have just used paypal the 0.005 btc i payed would have been 240 today. \nso what i want to point out is, i wouldnt want to pay with my 50 bitcoin that potentially could be worth double the price in a month.\n\nenglish is not my first language so i hope i could explain my ""concern"" :)\n\nbut i actually dont know if thats something of significance. does that even matter? and if yes what would have to change?","i do,  i use it to pay for my virtual office and mailbox. one of the few business that i have ever seen accept it, i would use it more if i could\n\nmy reasoning is that now crypto is mooning, now is the time for me to use it, and i can buy it back in the next bear market. for this reason i am selling 1% of my crypto for fiat every week, and spending it where i can. im not going through another 2017 and regretting keeping it all and watching everything collapse. i'll buy back in in the next accumilation zone\n\ni use lightcoin",0

"nano - a promising coin that is struggling to get mass adoption. what is holding this project back? hey all, this is my first post here so don't want this to look like i'm shilling at all so i won't go through any of the positives of this coin. but i was wondering after following nano for a little while, what is stopping the project from taking off given all its upsides? as well as its constant drop back over the top 100?\n\nis it the lack of development? it is marketing? or the spam attacks that it suffered leaving a bad taste? and possible even a nice little mix of all three.\n\ni'd like to know peoples opinion on this one.\n\nmany thanks!","I think what holds it back is primarily that Nano just works. There is no hyping of ""smart contracts coming"", ""this update will reduce fees"", ""NFTs will boom on this chain"" etc. It just works.\n\nCoupled with the general obsession with NFTs, Defi, staking etc, which I believe are more about getting rich fast, and Nano currently gets rather lost in the crowd.\n\nThen to top it off, the Dev team is honest and moral. They don't do tons of interviews and hype constantly, they just plug away. They have a tiny Dev fund because Nano was given away freely, without an ICO, and none of that Dev fund gets spent on marketing.\n\nNano's time will come when crypto starts being actually adopted. As a currency, it's honestly fantastic. It's what people think crypto is before using it, and in the long run I think those fundamentals will win out.",1
"what is a problem in crypto that needs a third-party solution? crypto is still very new and it is not going to get a lot of mainstream adoption until some things get smoothed out, like making sure that an address is correct or gas fees or instantaneous transactions, yadda yadda...\n\nbut what about crypto-adjacent solutions that can make things easier for people to feel safer and more secure? i'm thinking things like wallets and secure browsers and things like that. but i'm not sure we need a thousand more wallet applications...?\n\nwhat do you think is a problem in crypto that can be solved with a third-party solution? if a company had enough resources to offer and develop solutions for the cryptocurrency community, what do you think would be helpful? or what do you think is going to be a big thing that if someone figures out will be huge for the community as a whole?","Its pretty hard to screw up copy paste and if you have enough confidence, transactions stop being stressful and become mundane.",0
