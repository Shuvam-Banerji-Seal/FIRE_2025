Please forgive my ignorance and lack of understanding. Let me clarify something. So people bought NFTs and put them as display pics on social media as a flex right. And some of these NFTs were of pics/memes already existing in digital form or as a soft copy. So what exactly were people buying here? Was the NFT in a different file format or what and was this file format inaccessible for others to create digital media in? Coz for example if I just go on the person's Twitter I have the monkey as a screenshot which is digital media??? =-=-=-Somebody help me here I really tried understanding =F<Ã½,video_34680,5

They say this kinda stuff knowing the average investor is going to hold off on buying till bitcoin has this low he is speaking of but really the big picture painted is that it only goes up from here. But in my eyes its a double edged sword. Buy now and they see everything because its public and become exit liquidity or wait till you think its going to go down to 3-7k and it just goes up from here and you miss the opportunity. This is why you shouldnt even buy bitcoin. It has no real purpose so why not buy something that is going to give you bigger gains.

"Guys, like everything, it's up to you what you want to see here... It can be the massive revolutionary change or a big scam. Leave and let die, no?

Plus, let's take a moment and reflect on realities and reason for many of the users (me included): traditional finance is also seen like a big scam which can create money out of the blue if an entity or country wants or needs to, don't you think?

Many countries can't rely in their currencies due to the unstoppable blockages that the system impose to them, not being able to even save in their currency... Even the dollar has a lot of inflation and the country is on around 35 TRILLION dollars of debt... That's a massive scam, guys! 

Even if we are wrong or this is our own trap, why is that it's so difficult to let us drawn and fu*k things up? Whenever the banks that are robbing everyone constantly go broke, the system uses tax payers money to save them... Why don't you make these connections in your video? Many of the things that you describe as so bad are nothing but a digital version of things that currently happen in real world... With the difference of every transaction getting recorded (leaving on a side the TornadoCash-style cases, fair enough).

Even if there's a lot of speculation and hype, just let us be! We have been sustaining the current system with no other choice so far... What's the problem of some people putting their money somewhere else? Unless you are, maybe, scared of it... Scared of people having a chance of avoiding unneeded third parties for transactions, avoiding the dollar or avoiding simply the system that always denied justice to them... There's not even 1% of the world's assets in this and you are extremely sensitive... 

Like someone said in the video, it's really good and valid content, but it looks like you still need to add more context and to explain better the context, how traditional finance works and why people are taking such risk... Maybe then, we could validate your video a bit more, as I also consider NFTs a scam, but trhere are many other aspects of this that are an absolute piece of art (from my perspective), and due to misinformation like yours, many people continue not to understand things)...

It looks like this won't stop, so you can join us or not, but whether you like it or not, doing these things will also help this project/s... Many people will continue to choose not to join and potentially to judge us, but this is still marketing and helps us growing, even though the sensitive side of things... Let us crash our lives if we want to! We have been paying with our tax money to save millions of rich people from the private sector, and don't forget, each year there are more and more millionaires, when in parallel more and more debt is absorbed (or generated) by states... Don't you see that it's the current system that is allowing all this imminent crash to happen? Some of us choose to believe in this technology (knowing there's a lot of scam and bad things included in the pack) and that's fine... If you want to continue supporting the traditional system, that's your problem. Just make sure you are happy and that you can have a good life... Just remember, many people are paying the costs of this corrupt system, whether that's in your same country or not.

Live and let die.",video_26955,3

Bitcoin has no utility and those that have done proper research know this, hence why it is called crypto gold.

Now, there are a few (not many) cryptos with utility that solve REAL world problems. This means that 99% of cryptos WILL go to zero and be erased from existence.

If you think otherwise then ask world governments why they've adopted only certain cryptos into their financial tech plans for the future. These cryptos are in LEGAL documents found on the official websites of some major financial institutions.

Look up ISO 20022 and come back to this comment.

"This video is awesome, but misses the point. Yes, so many people tried to make make money and scam people with blockchain technology. That is what humans do. But the very original idea of Bitcoin is still very valid, namely that governments and banks cannot be trusted with monopoly control of our money. Every fiat currency in history has either gone to zero or will eventually. Bitcoin is like gold in many ways; it has properties that make it better in some ways and worse in others. We don't need it yet for transactions, but we may if the impact of money printing hyperinflates the dollar (and it can be scaled with technologies like the Lighting Network, we just don't need that yet). It also serves as a store of wealth much like gold. Yes, it is volatile now because it is such a relatively small market and government is motivated to suppress it, but it is a good hedge against monetary debasement.",video_30815,3

The reversal was imminent because obviously, The bitcoin market needed a correction to gather the right momentum to give the bulls more steam and this just makes it the perfect time to invest and accumulate as much as possible. I'd strongly advise any newbie/traders to buy the dip for traders who are still wondering to enter the market or old time traders who are Holders to seek help from not just any trader but an established trading expert with at least 89% accuracy.
