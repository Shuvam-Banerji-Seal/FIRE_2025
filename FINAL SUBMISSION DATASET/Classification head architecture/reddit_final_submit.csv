Diffusion DEX - Powering liquidity for the Cosmos EVM.,"&gt;Diffusion is a *Uniswap v2 fork* with *highest TVL in EVMOS*, still after nomad hack (pun intended). One of the first recognized AMMs for Evmos, an EVM on Cosmos that leverages the Cosmos SDK to enable use cases around composability, interoperability, and fast-finality. On July 6th, Diffusion crossed $100M in total cumulated trading volume.\n\nYou can interact with Diffusion by adding EVMOS RPC (pokt rpc gateway is prefrerred)  from [chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org/) into Metamask and thereby doing transactions with it. The process is really simple. Keplr, as of the date of writing this article, does not fully support signing EVM transactions. This means that some of the interactions will be only supported by Metamask. As soon as it's fixed, Diffusion is ready to deploy the wallet integration to mainnet thereby bringing native cosmos users from keplr.\n\nDiffusion takes a **0.30% fee** per trade to maintain constant product pools. 0.25% fee goes to the liquidity provider. The other 0.05% are added to the treasury to buy the Diffusion token DIFF as a staking reward for DIFF stakers. Yes, staking is enabled and at the time of this writing APR sits somewhere around \~152%. ***(Oh and btw ve staking model is in works :) )***\n\n45% of the daily released Diffusion tokens will be used for liquidity mining on farms. The process of selecting the pools and the corresponding rewards distribution will be subject to governance votes. I have talked with diffusion devs (@0xStrike) on discord regarding governance and it's currently being worked upon. You can also find in-depth information to make the best decisions while trading on the Diffusion analytics page. Please go to [**https://info.diffusion.fi/**](https://info.diffusion.fi/) to review all tokens, liquidity pairs, and on-chain transactions that have been connected to Diffusion.\n\n$DIFF total supply is 326M tokens. The incentives derived from the $DIFF token will be distributed over time to the right governance participants. For this reason, $DIFF will be fundamental in efforts to incentivize liquidity. Just like *Bitcoin halvening* there will be *Diffusion thirdening (but each year).* This means first year there will be 91M tokens, then 61M tokens will be released in second year and so on. This process will take at least 10 years to reach the total 326M supply.\n\nDiffusion team is very straightforward and don't hesistate to take steps. One instance would be after the nomad hack. They made a proposal in gravity governance to bring in liquidity and stables to EVMOS ecosystem. My advice would be, don't miss out on this absolute hidden gem. We will definitely witness the growth of TVL in coming weeks/months during EVMOS bull run\n\nHappy EVMOS,  \nYour Anon fren","Diffusion DEX - Powering liquidity for the Cosmos EVM.&gt;Diffusion is a *Uniswap v2 fork* with *highest TVL in EVMOS*, still after nomad hack (pun intended).

Scammed by FAKE Michael Saylor YT live stream,"tl;dr sent majority of my ETH holding to a scam wallet address due to a fake phishing live stream posing as MicroStrategy.\n\n-\n\nFirst post on Reddit, otherwise an observer.\n\nPosting this for awareness. Even if reaches one ?new? person then I have succeeded.\n\nThis may be common knowledge to some of you but I didn?t know fake live streams were a thing. I had never seen one until tonight.\n\nHaving been inactive and away from the space for about 9 months I decided to jump back in today (previously, I had just bought and held so I am no trader). I came across a live stream that seemed legitimate. It was an interview with Michael Saylor, and the channel hosting the interview was indeed MicroStrategy. They were touting a BTC and ETH giveaway at bonusbtc.io in some text surrounding the ?live-streamed? video whereby you send the seemingly legitimate address a set amount of BTC or ETH and you receive a small multiple in return, credited to the sender?s address. There is even a ?live? log of transactions ffs.\n\nGiven MicroStrategy?s large holding I didn?t even think (particularly with Saylor playing in front of me). Idk why tf I did not question this. I?ve never seen a fake live before so never expected this kind of phishing scam. Long and short, I sent the scamming scumbags 1 ETH before realising this was all BS 30 mins later. From a total initial holding of 1.2 tokens purchased with my pay-check I have the fraction remaining.\n\nI feel insanely stupid and hurt, particularly having recently become unemployed some 4 weeks ago due to lockdowns. Something my 12 year old self would have, and present 30 year old self should have, picked up as a phishing attempt. Glad to phishing attempts and scams are evolving and rampant. \n\nFor clarity, I lost this due to my own stupidity and nativity so am posting this for awareness not sympathy. I hope someone else can see this and gain some awareness that fake live-streams are a thing.\n\nAlso have no f*****g idea why platforms like YT display these fakes in the side bar to users.

Don't underestimate hype,"First of all I want to be clear: The best way to make steady and safe gains is to DYOR and invest in good long term projects that will keep growing. The obvious choices here are BTC and ETH, but needless to say not the only ones(looking at you ALGO and DOT). \n\nMy point is, this is a highly irrational market due to the fact it is still relatively new, and there is lots of ignorant people hoping to become rich. The good thing about this is that you can take this to your advantage. Irrational hype and marketing (whether it is good or bad) can make any coin skyrocket, even if it is the shittiest coin out  there. Only during the past few weeks we have seen this phenomenon in this sub, the best examples being SHIBA and LRC. It doesn't matter if the hype is justified or not, the only true fact is that those coins pumped like hell.\n\nAs a conclusion, if you are weary enough, you can make some nice gains through shitcoins in a short period of time, if you are early enough. This sub alone is a good place to identify the hype, so take it into account.\n\nPD: Never invest into any shitcoin or memecoin after it has already pumped, that would be the worst mistake.","don't underestimate hype first of all i want to be clear: the best way to make steady and safe gains is to dyor and invest in good long term projects that will keep growing. the obvious choices here are btc and eth, but needless to say not the only ones(looking at you algo and dot). \n\nmy point is, this is a highly irrational market due to the fact it is still relatively new, and there is lots of ignorant people hoping to become rich. the good thing about this is that you can take this to your advantage. irrational hype and marketing (whether it is good or bad) can make any coin skyrocket, even if it is the shittiest coin out there. only during the past few weeks we have seen this phenomenon in this sub, the best examples being shiba and lrc. it doesn't matter if the hype is justified or not, the only true fact is that those coins pumped like hell.\n\nas a conclusion, if you are weary enough, you can make some nice gains through shitcoins in a short period of time, if you are early enough. this sub alone is a good place to identify the hype, so take it into account.\n\npd: never invest into any shitcoin or memecoin after it has already pumped, that would be the worst mistake.",3
Mining predictions going into 2022 as a 1 year veteran.,"We all know that sometime in the near future that ETH is going to POS. I think itâ€™s likely this will happen late Q1 early Q2 as many devs have predicted. Something I think will happen though is that ETC will stand to gain a lot of support and their for positive price action. This price action could stand to put the coin in a position to hold upward of 1/6 of current ETH hashrate which would be entirely GPUS. Combine this with the price action of RVN and potentially ergo and we could see a situation where 1/2 of the ETH hashrate is a absorbed with ease. This is good as ETHâ€™s network hashrate is likely to be 30% ASIC miners that cannot mine ETC(currently), RVN, and ergo. \n    It has also been predicted that gpu supply is unlikely to increase much during the end of 2021 and 2022 making it difficult for new miners to get in and old miners to expand without great cost . We can expect gpu hashrate to stay around where it is now unless a significant amount of hardware enters the network from gamers and retailers. I think itâ€™s a safe bet to continue mining into 2022 and not selling cards off early. Time in the market &gt; timing. Itâ€™s also plausible that even if cards do hit the used market they will still be costly as new cards are entering the market at a snail pace. \n What do you guys think about the current mining situation and whatâ€™s your plans going into 2022.

"Lessons, mistakes and HODL on from someone who has seen it since 2013","In 2013 I discovered bitcoin and was fascinated by the project and having a global payment network, free from corruption, crony capitalism, and manipulation.\n\nIt was a theory that one day institutions would be here - provide price appreciation, stability, acceptance. \n\nSometimes we have to be careful for what we wish for - Institutions are here, and yes they are manipulating the market in big ways - they made money on the UP, DOWN, and now are accumulating for the final UP. \n\nThe only way to protect yourself and stop this? Donï¿½t SELL - Just HODL and buy.\n\nThere will ever only be 21M bitcoin EVER. Not everyone will make it, since people are focused on price but rather value. This is bound to happen in every cycle in price discovery stages till we reach global adoption - over 1B+ people this later decade.\n\nWarren Buffet famously said ï¿½Price is what you pay, value is what you get.ï¿½ Even WB got it wrong with Bitcoin and thatï¿½s okay, many others will too. If you spend 100+ hours studying Bitcoin and the blockchain you wouldnï¿½t panic but embrace this volatility. Think about the long term.\n\nBitcoin is growing at 200% a year, no other asset class will come close. With that said, we will be in for a very turbulent ride. Find me one asset class that will or has outperformed Bitcoin or will? - Donï¿½t worry Iï¿½ll wait. I havenï¿½t found one and sleep comfy.\n\nIï¿½ll never forget the thread on bitcointalk ï¿½Gentlemen, Iï¿½m confident we are part of the new wealthy elite.ï¿½ A thread created in 2010 when bitcoin was mere cents/dollars. The proof of work has been there since the 10k Bitcoins for a pizza, we have created a market, eco-system and global payments network that is revolutionary. I remember in 2013 everyone was saying ï¿½We missed the boat, buying at $200-500 is too expensive, imagine buying for $1.ï¿½ \n\nHow many wish you could of went back? Well you canï¿½t. Truth is those that sell will pay a higher price in the future, and will say ï¿½Wish I never sold my BTC for low 30ï¿½s/wish I bought more.ï¿½\n\nWhen Bitcoin hits 500k-1m a coin this dip will look like the 2013 one - I canï¿½t even see it on the chart. Take that for still being early we are still only at 1% penetration.\n\nWith 18.7M in circulation -\n- 1M belongs to satoshi (never sold)\n- 1.7M belongs to institutions \n-  Estimated 2-4M gone forever \n- Large/early adopters holding \n\nI estimate roughly 13M or LESS left for the whole world. That number shrinks each day. If youï¿½re fortunate enough to buy and HODL 0.28-1 BTC you will be forever wealthy. Do your research.\n\nAs inflation ramps up, with mass money printing  (fiat will collapse in many countries) and become as useful as toilet paper. EVERY single fiat currency has failed. If I had 50K in cash and went into a 10 year coma - Iï¿½d be lucky if it still had purchasing power. Conversely If I had one bitcoin Iï¿½d wake up a wealthy man.

Why Bitcoin is on track to hit $100k,"Alright guys, I took some time to do some research on price projection on Bitcoin. I know you all don't want to hear some big words and nerd shit so here goes:\n\nBitcoin will reach $100k in a year because I said so. I always dreamed that 2022 will be the year and have always played it out in my mind; not to mention that I lost a shit-ton of money by leveraging shitcoins, resulting in my wife letting her boyfriend move in and take my side of the bed. It is that kind of loss which makes me a hopium addict, so I inject that shit right into my veins and it makes me so high that I start hallucinating about owing not 1, not 2, not 3, but 4 lambos and living the life of a wife-stealer.","why bitcoin is on track to hit $100k alright guys, i took some time to do some research on price projection on bitcoin. i know you all don't want to hear some big words and nerd shit so here goes:\n\nbitcoin will reach $100k in a year because i said so. i always dreamed that 2022 will be the year and have always played it out in my mind; not to mention that i lost a shit-ton of money by leveraging shitcoins, resulting in my wife letting her boyfriend move in and take my side of the bed. it is that kind of loss which makes me a hopium addict, so i inject that shit right into my veins and it makes me so high that i start hallucinating about owing not 1, not 2, not 3, but 4 lambos and living the life of a wife-stealer.",3
I'm not a crypto-millionaire,"I've been around since before the first altcoin was made.

My portfolios are still larger than anything else I've ever invested in. This space is so crazy that I almost accidentally made 100k in Jan by buying DOGE at a penny for a joke and hitting an extra 0 on my buy order. I realized my mistake and immediately sold it back. There is nothing else that I know of that can do these crazy things, and while I'm likely never going to hit it big, I'm staying around here.

Rethink HODL and why im not worried at all,"Hello fellow Crypto enthusiasts\n\nim still fairly new to crypto, so everything i say should be seen with a grain of salt.\n\nHere is my take on crypto, the recent dip and HODL.\n\nFirst of all, i think HODL should be reinvented from ""Hold On your Dear Life"" into ""Hold On and Dont Look"". It would save quiet some people here a lot of trouble and stomach issues. I feel like its not very healthy to look at the graphs every hour or so, really. \n\nSecond, you only should invest money which you can affort to lose. Seriously, before you buy stuff you should ask yourself: ""If I would lose this money right now, how much would it bother/hurt me""? Especially if you got family/wife/kids.(!!!) And this is an lifetime advice you should keep in mind everywhere, not only with crypto.\n\nThird, well and if you put a loan into a highly volatile and speculative market you are either very stupid or very stupid and lucky in my opinion.\n\nI try to keep holding myself onto the first 2 points as much as I can and thats why the recent dip doenst bother me in any way.

free btc,"Hi everyone. I, just like you, was searching for a site where I could spend some time each day and get some free crypto and amazon cards. The site is freeskins.com and I was skeptical at first, but it is endorsed by many popular content creators. So, I gave it a try. I grinded for about 3 weeks, then I redeemed bitcoin. This was the most important moment, and I wondered if the site would follow through. Sure enough they did. I received my 0.0015 Bitcoin and I continued the grind. So, I recommend this site to you! Simply go to freeskins.com, register, and use code ï¿½free\_100\_coinsï¿½ to receive 100 free coins. It worked for me and i'm sure it will for you too.","free btc  Hi everyone.

Central Banks Of France And Switzerland Successfully Completed Testing Of Cross-Border Payments In Digital Euros And Swiss Francs,"[Project Jura](https://www.bis.org/publ/othp44.pdf), named after the mountains between the two countries is a partnership between the Bank of France (BDF), the Swiss Innovation Center (BISIH), the Swiss National Bank (SNB), Accenture of Credit Suisse, Natixis, R3, SIX Digital Exchange (SDX) and UBS. The project was initiated by the Central Bank of France and continued a series of experiments to test international payments in central bank digital currency (CBDC).\n\nSylvie Goulard, Deputy Governor of the Bank of France said:\n\n***â€œWith the great success of Jura, the wholesale CBDC experiment program launched by the Banque de France in 2020 is now completed. Jura demonstrates how wholesale CBDC can optimize crossâ€‘currency and crossâ€‘border settlements, which are a key facet of international transactions.â€***\n\nThe participants in the experiment came to the conclusion that the European financial system needs perfect and universal mechanisms for payments and settlements because the existing mechanisms include numerous intermediaries and additional elements of the financial market infrastructure. As a result, cross-border transactions have unreasonably high costs, they are slow, technologically complex, and potentially risky.\n\nCBDC is a new technological approach for regulated financial institutions and central banks. A central bank-backed distributed ledger technology (DLT) based infrastructure can secure a financial ecosystem, offers more choice and competition in terms of cross-border payments and settlements.\n\nAndrÃ©a M Maechler, Swiss National Bank Board Member said:\n\n*â€œAs a small open economy, Switzerland requires efficient and robust crossâ€‘border payment and settlement arrangements. Project Jura explores how distributed ledger technology can be successfully leveraged to map out how futureâ€‘proof crossâ€‘border settlement between financial institutions could look like.â€*\n\nThe project participants tested direct transfers in euros and Swiss francs in the form of CBDC on a single DLT platform. The experiment was conducted under realistic conditions, using transactions with real value, in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, as well as using payment versus payment (PvP) and delivery versus payment (DvP) mechanisms.\n\nBISIH chief executive BenoÃ®t CÅ“urÃ© said:\n\n***â€œProject Jura confirms that a well-designed wholesale CBDC can play a critical role as a safe and neutral settlement asset for international financial transactions. It also demonstrates how central banks and the private sector can work together across borders to foster innovation.â€***\n\nWhile Project Jura was a success, both central banks have warned that a set of banking rules and monitoring procedures, as well as contingency procedures, need to be formulated to ensure that CBDCs can be used in practice.\n\nAndrÃ©a M Maechler, said:\n\n*â€œIt is an important experiment, the results have been very valuable, but there are many questions, both of a technological nature and very important policy questions which remain to be better understood.â€*Â \n\nCentral Banks of France and Switzerland announced the launch of a pilot project to test state digital currencies for international payments back in June this year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://thecryptobasic.com/2021/12/09/bank-of-france-and-swiss-national-bank-successfully-completed-testing-of-cross-border-payments-in-digital-euros-and-swiss-francs/](https://thecryptobasic.com/2021/12/09/bank-of-france-and-swiss-national-bank-successfully-completed-testing-of-cross-border-payments-in-digital-euros-and-swiss-francs/)","central banks of france and switzerland successfully completed testing of cross-border payments in digital euros and swiss francs [project jura]( named after the mountains between the two countries is a partnership between the bank of france (bdf), the swiss innovation center (bisih), the swiss national bank (snb), accenture of credit suisse, natixis, r3, six digital exchange (sdx) and ubs. the project was initiated by the central bank of france and continued a series of experiments to test international payments in central bank digital currency (cbdc).\n\nsylvie goulard, deputy governor of the bank of france said:\n\n***â€œwith the great success of jura, the wholesale cbdc experiment program launched by the banque de france in 2020 is now completed. jura demonstrates how wholesale cbdc can optimize crossâ€‘currency and crossâ€‘border settlements, which are a key facet of international transactions.â€***\n\nthe participants in the experiment came to the conclusion that the european financial system needs perfect and universal mechanisms for payments and settlements because the existing mechanisms include numerous intermediaries and additional elements of the financial market infrastructure. as a result, cross-border transactions have unreasonably high costs, they are slow, technologically complex, and potentially risky.\n\ncbdc is a new technological approach for regulated financial institutions and central banks. a central bank-backed distributed ledger technology (dlt) based infrastructure can secure a financial ecosystem, offers more choice and competition in terms of cross-border payments and settlements.\n\nandrÃ©a m maechler, swiss national bank board member said:\n\n*â€œas a small open economy, switzerland requires efficient and robust crossâ€‘border payment and settlement arrangements. project jura explores how distributed ledger technology can be successfully leveraged to map out how futureâ€‘proof crossâ€‘border settlement between financial institutions could look like.â€*\n\nthe project participants tested direct transfers in euros and swiss francs in the form of cbdc on a single dlt platform. the experiment was conducted under realistic conditions, using transactions with real value, in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, as well as using payment versus payment (pvp) and delivery versus payment (dvp) mechanisms.\n\nbisih chief executive benoÃ®t cÅ“urÃ© said:\n\n***â€œproject jura confirms that a well-designed wholesale cbdc can play a critical role as a safe and neutral settlement asset for international financial transactions. it also demonstrates how central banks and the private sector can work together across borders to foster innovation.â€***\n\nwhile project jura was a success, both central banks have warned that a set of banking rules and monitoring procedures, as well as contingency procedures, need to be formulated to ensure that cbdcs can be used in practice.\n\nandrÃ©a m maechler, said:\n\n*â€œit is an important experiment, the results have been very valuable, but there are many questions, both of a technological nature and very important policy questions which remain to be better understood.â€*Â \n\ncentral banks of france and switzerland announced the launch of a pilot project to test state digital currencies for international payments back in june this year.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n[",4

I have very limited knowledge when it comes to web development (which is crucial for building blockchain apps). I also need a refresher on the basics of a Blockchain (How do they work, how addresses are generated, Private and Public Keys, etc.). I also have 0 knowledge about Blockchain Coding Languages, and very limited knowledge about the fundamentals like blocks, gas, nodes and clients, networks, mining, etc. \n\nAnyone that could provide a step by step would be very much appreciated! I don't know where to start. What should I learn first and how do I progress? What tools should I have? What resources should I watch or read?\n\nFor context, I have several app ideas to create. One of them is a Crypto-Remittance App in the Philippines. Remittances from Overseas Filipino Workers represent 10% of our GDP, iirc, which is huge. They are mostly sent using Remittance Centers like Western Union WU and they actually charge 5-10% on some transactions which is highway robbery!\n\nCryptocurrencies could offer an alternative at a fraction of the cost while being faster and more flexible than centralised ones like Western Union. \n\nMaybe this would be too much for me, I know 0 shit about blockchains, but I would still love to learn more about crypto while HODLing them.

"Something No One is Talking About, Why Algorand will Outrun Ethereum like a Beam of Light Outpaces the Likes of Usain Bolt","It is often said that ""there won't be just one winner"" and similar claims that the future world running on blockchain technology will be too vast to run on any one blockchain alone.\n\nI am here to say that this is far too modest compared to what Algorand is capable of.\n\nThe biggest defense of the shitshow called Ethereum is that L2 Rollups together with data sharding will bring a newfound capacity to the Ethereum blockchain on the order of 100,000 tx/s compared to its current L1 throughput of 15 tx/s. \n\nWithout sharding rollups are expected to bring to Ethereum a throughput of 3,000 tx/s. 15 to 3000 is a 200x multiplier.\n\nNow considering that Algorand is capable of upgrading to 46,000 tx/s by pipelining and some modest tweaks to blockspeed and blocksize without trading away security or decentralization, if the same L2 rollup technologies were implemented on Algorand the network throughput could be expanded to 9,200,000 tx/s!

"First crypto I bought, ETC.","A few days ago I went into the crypto world and bought this, assuming it was related somehow with Ethereum. So I think I?m not the only person that got confused. Starting to read over here and know I?m wrong... but I?m already starting to put some profit into ADA and ETH. Hope I?m doing the right thing.

Reddit + Kraken = Match made in Heaven!,"I have some HOPIUM for all of us this lovely Thursday morning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**HOPIUM #1 -** [The Moon Beginner guide on Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-reddit-moon)\n\nKraken is the only top exchange who's every spoken about the moons, and they have a detailed guide on what moons are, what is a vault, how to earn moons etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**HOPIUM #2 -** With some lurking, I got to find that Kraken CEO himself has a whopping 235 moons.\n\nSo he's already tasted our delicious delicious moons. Am pretty sure he's gonna root for them (This is just my gut feeling though, I haven't asked him about this ofcourse lol) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**HOPIUM #3 -** Talking about Kraken CEO, guess who has one of the only 4 Reddit CryptoSnoos? You guessed it right, Mr Kraken CEO, that's who! This tells us that Kraken really values Reddit and its crypto ventures. This in my opinion is super super bullish! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe owns the [Snooprematic](https://opensea.io/assets/0xbfb99893d04f72e2916c8f266e1b2962871a8dd4/3) ( [https://imgur.com/a/tzrKO1Y](https://imgur.com/a/tzrKO1Y) ) which in my opinion was the most DOPE looking NFT amongst the first 3 CryptoSnoos launched by Reddit. It was sold for a whopping 115 ETH  which at the time of posting this is a whopping $3,58,385.52!!! \n\n*Sidenote - I tried to spy to see which reddit users bought the other two snoos but the OpenSea username does not match the Reddit username, so I guess those who bought it arent even Reddit users?? But I digress..* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll this tells me that Kraken has really been keeping an eye on Reddit and our Moons and when we hit Mainnet, we really might just get listed on Kraken sooner rather than later! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, personally, Kraken is one of the only top exchanges who have a great human customer support, and have only read good reviews about it, so I'd love to see it get listed first amongst any other top exchanges.","reddit + kraken = match made in heaven! i have some hopium for all of us this lovely thursday morning. \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n**hopium #1 -** [the moon beginner guide on kraken]( is the only top exchange who is every spoken about the moons, and they have a detailed guide on what moons are, what is a vault, how to earn moons etc. \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n**hopium #2 -** with some lurking, i got to find that kraken ceo himself has a whopping 235 moons.\n\nso he is already tasted our delicious delicious moons. am pretty sure he is gonna root for them (this is just my gut feeling though, i haven't asked him about this ofcourse lol) \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n**hopium #3 -** talking about kraken ceo, guess who has one of the only 4 reddit cryptosnoos? you guessed it right, mr kraken ceo, that is who! this tells us that kraken really values reddit and its crypto ventures. this in my opinion is super super bullish! \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nhe owns the [snooprematic]( ( [ ) which in my opinion was the most dope looking nft amongst the first 3 cryptosnoos launched by reddit. it was sold for a whopping 115 eth which at the time of posting this is a whopping $3,58,385.52!!! \n\n*sidenote - i tried to spy to see which reddit users bought the other two snoos but the opensea username does not match the reddit username, so i guess those who bought it arent even reddit users?? but i digress..* \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nall this tells me that kraken has really been keeping an eye on reddit and our moons and when we hit mainnet, we really might just get listed on kraken sooner rather than later! \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nalso, personally, kraken is one of the only top exchanges who have a great human customer support, and have only read good reviews about it, so i'd love to see it get listed first amongst any other top exchanges.",4
