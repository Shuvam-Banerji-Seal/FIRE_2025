However we are comfortable that these sell for millions because we grew up with these.   OTOH, if you agree that a rare vintage Ferrari can be worth a million, then so can crypto.  For anything to have value, all it takes is millions of people agreeing it has value.  For example the same house in an expensive neighborhood is double the price because everyone accepts that.  If so, it's the same for crypto.  Once millions accept that it has value, then it does, because there will always be buyers and sellers at that price.   You can argue that one day there might not be buyers.  Well, when the earthquake hit San Francisco in 1989 there were no buyers so the houses suddenly went down in value.   But no one says houses are a scam.   Please feel free to post opposite views if you are logical, polite / civil.

{"comment_id": "video_25638", "comment": "Thank you for your videos mate.... With Trump's presidency, economic shifts are expected to be significant, especially given the current recession and the potential impact of future rate cuts. Although rate cuts might not boost inflation as hoped, they may lead banks to further restrict consumer and corporate lending, contributing to a deflationary period for various assets. This environment could result in declining stock values, retail and housing sales, and rising unemployment due to layoffs. For investors, a diversified portfolio especially with stocks and cryptocurrencies offers some protection, serving as a hedge amid volatility. Both long- and short-term trading strategies can help manage risks, providing stability as markets adjust. I have managed to grow a nest egg of around 130k to a decent 532k in the space of a few months...

He listen the sales pitch with us then just asked a simple question \"that's all great, but who's going to be buying this?\"  right now I see crypto largely if not only used by people who want to get rich from crypto, so who else is buying it? where else is it used.  Maybe in another few hundreds years humanity will look at crypto the same way we look today at Leonardo's drawing of a proto-helicopter.  Back then it would never have taken off the ground if anyone tried, but it was an idea ahead of it's time.  Perhaps the crypto is one of those.

As rewards decrease over time, the appeal for new people to join Kaspa may also diminish. This raises the question, why even join Kaspa?\n\nI\u0019m not here to shill, just trying to speak the truth. Kaspa\u0019s rapid emission rate is leading to centralization, with most coins ending up in the hands of a few. While its BlockDAG technology provides speed, it struggles with implementing smart contracts effectively. In contrast, Nexa operates on a steady emission model like Bitcoin and combines both BlockDAG and blockchain elements. This combination offers the security of a blockchain with the speed of a BlockDAG, setting Nexa up for a more decentralized and scalable future. As Nexa gains momentum, it\u0019s positioned to be a game-changer in the crypto space.", "level_1": 2, "level_2": 0, "level_3": 0, "datatype": "Neutral sentiment"}

To that naive guy that thinks this chain can go on forever, but in reality, as the price keeps going up, it becomes increasingly more difficult to sell it at increasingly higher prices. The only people making money with this are the \u001cwolves\u001d that know how to navigate the market short term fluctuations, buying low and quickly selling high, while the \u001csheeps\u001d get slaughtered, doing exactly the opposite, and of course, the market creators, who don\u0019t care what Bitcoin does, as long as they can charge their transaction fees.

Leave and let die, no?\n\nPlus, let's take a moment and reflect on realities and reason for many of the users (me included): traditional finance is also seen like a big scam which can create money out of the blue if an entity or country wants or needs to, don't you think?\n\nMany countries can't rely in their currencies due to the unstoppable blockages that the system impose to them, not being able to even save in their currency... Even the dollar has a lot of inflation and the country is on around 35 TRILLION dollars of debt... That's a massive scam, guys! \n\nEven if we are wrong or this is our own trap, why is that it's so difficult to let us drawn and fu*k things up? Whenever the banks that are robbing everyone constantly go broke, the system uses tax payers money to save them... Why don't you make these connections in your video? Many of the things that you describe as so bad are nothing but a digital version of things that currently happen in real world... With the difference of every transaction getting recorded (leaving on a side the TornadoCash-style cases, fair enough).\n\nEven if there's a lot of speculation and hype, just let us be! We have been sustaining the current system with no other choice so far... What's the problem of some people putting their money somewhere else? Unless you are, maybe, scared of it... Scared of people having a chance of avoiding unneeded third parties for transactions, avoiding the dollar or avoiding simply the system that always denied justice to them... There's not even 1% of the world's assets in this and you are extremely sensitive... \n\nLike someone said in the video, it's really good and valid content, but it looks like you still need to add more context and to explain better the context, how traditional finance works and why people are taking such risk... Maybe then, we could validate your video a bit more, as I also consider NFTs a scam, but trhere are many other aspects of this that are an absolute piece of art (from my perspective), and due to misinformation like yours, many people continue not to understand things)...\n\nIt looks like this won't stop, so you can join us or not, but whether you like it or not, doing these things will also help this project/s... Many people will continue to choose not to join and potentially to judge us, but this is still marketing and helps us growing, even though the sensitive side of things... Let us crash our lives if we want to! We have been paying with our tax money to save millions of rich people from the private sector, and don't forget, each year there are more and more millionaires, when in parallel more and more debt is absorbed (or generated) by states... Don't you see that it's the current system that is allowing all this imminent crash to happen? Some of us choose to believe in this technology (knowing there's a lot of scam and bad things included in the pack) and that's fine... If you want to continue supporting the traditional system, that's your problem. Just make sure you are happy and that you can have a good life... Just remember, many people are paying the costs of this corrupt system, whether that's in your same country or not.\n\nLive and let die.", "level_1": 2, "level_2": 1, "level_3": null, "datatype": "Negative"}

This was more than just a business; it was my dream and source of hope.\n\nCompounding my struggles, I lost a $10,000 loan from family members who are now pressing me for repayment. I also invested in a memecoin called Cheepepe, hoping for a better future, but lost everything there too.\n\nAt just 20 years old, I\u0019m at a crossroads. I can either fight to build a life with the girl I love or give up entirely. We\u0019re working hard to manage our finances and dream of moving out of the country together, but the weight of these setbacks feels unbearable.\n\nI know there are many scams online, and it\u0019s shameful for me to ask for help. But I truly have nowhere else to turn. To prove my situation, I\u0019m willing to share my NID and any documentation you might need.\n\nIf you can find it in your heart to help, even the smallest contribution would mean the world to us. You can reach me via WhatsApp at +8801711378947 or email me at kbc.restaurant23@gmail.com.\u00a0\n\nHere are my cryptocurrency addresses for donations:\n\n\n- USDT (TRC20): TGRZdbDGGa5J8bK9ykwFt4dF99kGWU1oj8\u00a0\u00a0\n\n- BNB: 0x77414494EcAF9306FDD3d42c4996108A4db39c67\u00a0\u00a0\n\n- Solana: NygSBqWGUAMfxXpEXgE1KQe6gdWDS5iPuH9NAoGcqgy\u00a0\u00a0\n\n- ETH: 0x77414494EcAF9306FDD3d42c4996108A4db39c67\u00a0\u00a0\n\n- BTC: bc1qh9st95gpln8806awcweslfsqgl22peucrnnjwm\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my story.

{"comment_id": "video_26404", "comment": "Saying that a deflationary currency is inherently wrong for transactions makes your whole argument moot in my opinion. And with Trump coming in saying he's going to put more into Bitcoin, it sounds like it's becoming a reserve currency. Even if Bitcoin is only for B2B transactions, it still has value. The fact that it's inherently deflationary means people will want to invest in it because it's an incredibly great store of value unlike anything we've ever seen, and countries can't cheat it either. This _is_ the revolution we dreamed about. And only 15 years later? To change the whole financial system? That's not a goal you'd ever imagine happening in under 100 years, yet it's happening now!\n\nBitcoin still has issues of not being useful for micro transactions. There's room for improvement. Lightning isn't gonna DeFi Bitcoin; in fact, it's the opposite. The great thing about Bitcoin is those improvements can be added. Just like how other alt coins have tried to solve this with a 2-currency system, Bitcoin can do something similar. There could be a micro-transaction currency that has lower fees and compute costs. How that'd be part of Bitcoin is something we'd find in the future. As soon as Bitcoin becomes more mainstream, there will eventually be a solution. People are working hard on these problems, and in just a few years, a whitepaper about solving the financial crisis was made into the best store of value in existence!\n\nNFTs are something else. They've got value, yet they've been only used by scammers.

There is alot of overlap with AI here in the WEB 3.0 narrative, it makes sense...we can see where its all heading. Do we seriously think that all technology stops here at web 2.0?! Yes its a risk, but no risk no reward....you're crazy if you go all in! \n4. Bitcoin uses lots of energy yes, but miners are now looking for cheaper solutions to lower their costs which creates innovation for cheaper energy! Michael Saylor has talked lots on this....its great idea!\n5. Any asset you buy relies on someone paying a higher price, thats not unique to crypto. Remember these are NOT companies so of course there is no revenue generated. One can justify stocks because they generate profit....but thats just a way to justify it. Many things go up in price that are not companies, like old antiques sitting on your shelf at home. \n\nCrypto imo has value because I can send money instantly and dead cheap........cant do that easily with fiat!

{"comment_id": "video_131680", "comment": "You are god. Bitcoin is a reflection of the global economy. When the global economy grows, Bitcoin thrives, and during economic downturns, it dips. But here\u0019s the thing\u0014we are in the middle of several industrial revolutions. The cost of labor, once $100, can now be reduced to $1 with robots. Thanks to advanced 3D printing, everything becomes cheaper, making people wealthier. Imagine a future where $1 could buy 10 mansions, or they pay you to live in them for free.\n\nWhat happens to Bitcoin in this scenario? It rises. As the economy becomes more efficient and accessible, the value of decentralized, unmanipulated assets like Bitcoin becomes even clearer. It\u0019s not just about holding a piece of Bitcoin\u0014it\u0019s about holding a stake in the inevitable evolution of global finance.\n\nAnd just like some unconventional factors boost economies, Bitcoin is part of that shift. Did you know spicy food eaters live 16% longer, or professional ping-pong players enjoy healthier, longer lives? Promoting these habits benefits not only individuals but the economy as a whole. Similarly, more sexual activity boosts testosterone, which drives productivity and growth\u0014another unexpected economic boon.\n\nSo when robots, 3D printers, or even your morning chili-infused breakfast create value and abundance, Bitcoin becomes the ultimate store of value in a world where traditional systems struggle to adapt. The question isn't just how much Bitcoin you have; it's whether you're prepared for the profound shifts we're living through. =\u0080", "level_1": 2, "level_2": 1, "level_3": null, "datatype": "Negative"}

Had he or she remained involved in the project, it would have been only a matter of time before official authorities tracked him or her down, and the project would have failed. Additionally, the fact that he or she has never moved their coins is crucial; otherwise, it would concentrate too much supply in their hands.\n\nThe comparison to Bernie Madoff is nonsensical because he was a single individual, albeit with a few co-conspirators, trying to enrich himself. Discussing one's investments is a normal part of life, whether it involves stocks, real estate, jewelry, or paintings. Could everything be a Ponzi scheme?\n\n00:14:26 \"People only make money because some other sucker lost more\" is an inaccurate statement. Person A can sell to Person B while making a profit, and Person B can then sell to Person C and also make a profit. Even if Person C sells to Person D at a loss, the losses of Person C are not automatically greater than the combined profits of Person A and B. It's a baseless allegation, and the same logic could apply to any investment ever made.\n\nIt's important to note that most ICO projects have either failed or scammed their investors. However, some projects have found product-market fit, and they continue to operate, fulfilling real use-cases such as decentralized trading, permissionless borrowing and lending, and global fund transfers without the intervention or censorship of a third party.\n\nIt's not easy to see the value of Bitcoin and Ethereum while living in the Western world, where representative democracy and financial freedom are the norms. However, imagine living in a country with a totalitarian regime, or being oppressed by governments or institutions due to your race, sex, or beliefs.

I fucking dare you to compare Satoshi to the other founders of shitty crypto projects or celebrity endorsements or basically rug pulls.. you are not even worthy to talk about Satoshi when you obviously know nothing about Bitcoin.. most likely havent even read the white paper. I have no words to describe how misleading this video is, just trying to mix everything together like the Madoff scandal on Wall Street with crypto and Bitcoin... to give the appearance that Bitcoin founder Satoshi is just like Madoff and the whole thing is just a Get Rich Quick Scheme... because if that is the case then you tell me how many Bitcoins did Satoshi sell from his wallet when we were at the top of last bull run? Zero you fucking idiot. Does that look like a get rich quick scheme?? Huh? When all the bitcoins in Satoshis wallet (the very \"early investor\" as you would like to call him in your so called bitcoin get rich quick scheme) they just havent moved from that wallet in more than a decade... that would be the worst get rich quick scheme if you have to wait more than a decade to cash out. But obviously this dumbass never mentions this in his video because he knows nothing about bitcoin and Satoshi. And i could go on with all of the fallacies in this video... because seriously this guy just wants to sit comfortably in front of the camera and take advantage of his little fame and reputation to try to trash bitcoin when his knowledge and understanding has no comparison whatsoever with someone who went to MIT like Michael Saylor or someone who builds space rockets like Elon Musk... was someone as intelligent as Elon also  scammed into buying bitcoin?? Haha sure this pathetic influencer has more brains than Elon Musk or Michael Saylor.. yeah right. What is amazing though is amount os stupid people believing this kid and his very poor done research. This video is just about an angry baby whining in front of the camera that he fell for a rug pulled and lost money.. all because he didnt do a \"well reasearch\" before investing in whatever project or nft he lost money on. But to try to compare any of the scammers he talks about with Satoshi is seriously showing he doesnt understand Bitcoin whatsoever. He just made this video trashing Bitcoin because right now is a hot topic since we were just at the bottom of the bear market and he just wanted some views and monetize on them with whatever lies he could come up with. And just like he finishes his mediocre video... theres only one question left... whether in 5 years and 10 years and 20 years and 50 years bitcoin will be dead for the 400th time or if its value will be in the millions of dollars... thus making this dumbass and his video a fucking clown.

What you should actually be doing is checking the market cap of the coin. RIght now the marketcap right now is 4 billion dollars and its the 30th biggest coin in the world. So max to max u can get is like 3-4x return if you buy now. You cant expect it to go to 1 rs because if it hits 1rs then the total market cap of the coin will be 5.04 trillion dollars which is basically 2-3 times bigger than bitcoin aka the biggest and first crypto in the world.

If you believe something has value, then it will. Money is just the accumulation of everyones beliefs. The more people that believe, the more value it has. The less people believe, the less value it has. This is exactly why some currencies loose there power of value, while others gain.\n\nCryptocurrency is in a sense, the most perfect set of money ghe world has ever known. Its because, (unlike goverment money) atkeast all the people of the world has full control of it, and there is nothing governments can do about it. \n\nYour video can be applied to all forms of currency in a sence, but you need to include the accumulated beliefs of individuals to increase the value of a certain currency and make that the foundation of your understanding of it. Then you will have a much mire clearer picture of exactly what currency and vakue if monye really is. That makes all the difference.\n\nIts not a scam at all. Scams are designed to scam, don't do that at all. Its just a system of accumulated value. If its a scam, who looses? Fact is that the only way someone looses is if people stop believing it has value. \n\nIt really is that simple. Its why you need a one hour documentary describing it, its because your logic is theory based, with little foundation. You're creating theories out of thin air, then your linking the theories together without a foundation and calling it circumstantial evidence that proves your right. But you are leaving out the foundation of exactly what money really is. \n\nBuild your theories from the true foundation of what money really is and your picture will be clear.

{"comment_id": "video_42113", "comment": "I doubt my voice will be heard in an ocean of sceptics, but here goes my 2 cents. I mean this to be constructive criticism and hope it doesn't fall on deaf ears. \nWhile I agree with you on everything you say about NFTs, scamcoins, ICO mania, and the likes of it, I do not agree with what you say on bitcoin and how you put it in the same bag. Some of your points are lies, some are lies by omission but lies nonetheless, and it obfuscates the truth, quite the opposite of what you'd be trying to achieve with an educational documentary. I'm worried that this information will go as the \"truth\" on bitcoin, however I view the truth to be a process rather than a state so I hope my input will steer at least some people towards it.\n\n- You mention that bitcoin \"wastes\" (instead of \"uses\" for example) energy without mentioning the fact that it is the MOST secure network on earth. Bitcoin being a financial network, that is a pretty import fact.\n\n- Bitcoin indeed has only 7 transactions per second, but those transactions are final (i.e. can not be modified, ever), so you can not compare it to VISA where transactions can be rolled back even days after. Let's take the tx/s argument anyway: you make no mention of the lightning network which is EXPONENTIALLY (it can process millions of transactions already) faster than VISA and the likes and is just as secure as bitcoin because it is built on top of it.\n\n- The big talking point of bitcoin being a Ponzi because \"to make money on it, someone has to lose it\", if you think about it, that is how a market simply works. Take gold, silver, any other precious metal that is also traded speculatively, take even stocks, they work on the same principle, yet they're not called Ponzi schemes. The price in a market goes higher because of 2 things: (new) people buying and inflation.\n\n- You liken Satoshi to Madoff, while not said explicitly, it is implied and is a manipulation tactic to tarnish Satoshi's and bitcoin's reputation but since you are convinced that bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme I can see where you are coming from. Either way, the comparison is not honest on another front: Satoshi made bitcoin and just vanished and never, ever, mentioned that it will make you rich. He hoped that his invention might help humanity after seeing the corruption of the financial system, that's a lot more humble than what you make it out to be. Madoff was a criminal running his Ponzi and promising returns until the end, it doesn't fit you see?\n\n- You say that bitcoin is a failed revolution while ignoring how much people in South America and Africa are starting to use it. It is not obvious for people living in Western countries where the currencies are relatively stable but in countries where the currency is a lot less stable, using bitcoin is already making sense. Yet you assert multiple times that it has no real use cases. What do you say to those people, that have no real alternative because of inexistant banking system, corrupt government and/or unstable currency? Is their POSITIVE opinion on bitcoin insignificant or worth less than yours?\nYou declare bitcoin a failed revolution while it has existed only for 14 years. For comparison, the internet started in 1983, by the same logic you'd declare it a failed tech in the dot com crash in 2000 (17 years after inception), now look how much it has changed everything. It started to really accelerate in 2010, almost 30 years after creation. I think you see why calling bitcoin a fail is hasty conclusion.\n\n- You mention the Winklevoss twins, and how these two well-educated folks started stockpiling bitcoin, what is the issue of highly educated people realising that bitcoin is something great? If anything, you'd expect more educated individuals to understand why bitcoin is useful, how it works and why it will catch on. However, I do agree that the likes of Blackrock now investing in it is not ideal and doesn't make me ecstatic because of all the history of big banks/ asset managers manipulation markets, but oh well, it was bound to happen at some point.\n\n- Finally, we invest in bitcoin because number go up, yes, as with any investment, but that is not the sole reason. We, bitcoiners, believe that bitcoin is something that can truly free us from the government-owned currencies, we have had enough of the corruption of the government and hope that bitcoin will be the separation of state and money the same way we had separation from church and state. The greed will always be present, even in the most idealistic communities, but the greediest people in crypto have moved on from bitcoin to some scams likes NFTs, scam coins etc. Therefore, today, there are a lot more people buying it for idealistic reasons than because of greed. Will we still buy low and sell high to acquire more bitcoin? Of course, as any logical individual would do in a market, but greed is not our guiding force because of it.\n\nTo conclude, I think that the part on bitcoin was intellectually unhonest as is evidently implied by my lengthy comment on such a small fraction of the video. However, the video is very well made, easy to follow, exposes what needs to exposed, so good job for that. With great following comes great responsibility, so be careful what you say and how you say it.", "level_1": 2, "level_2": 1, "level_3": null, "datatype": "Negative"}
