Many teams could enjoy this week as almost all teams gained some valuable points. Growth points are here, and this season is getting spicy. There was some serious movement, and a couple of interesting results. \\n\\nBefore I present the results, here is also one important update, in the next week I will work on a subreddit called: Moonleague. Everybody who wants to follow the results or share some info during game week you are free to do so. Once the subreddit is ready I will inform you with a post. \\n\\nHere are the GAME WEEK 4 results: \\n\\n**Crypto.com vs. Cosmos**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s9ez93elm5r61.png?width=483&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4277a8497e883f484d372b8fca973cf636fdc725\\n\\nThis was a tight game. Crypto.com gained some valuable points this week with Visa piloting the capability with Crypto.com. Cosmos was also pretty active, as they launched IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication), and that are good news for the team. They have managed to get some nice growth points but it was a close battle, and Crypto.com took the victory this week \\n\\n**Tether vs. Uniswap**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/80wp9afom5r61.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56a621cc22fe099dcad72b956869a4bdb3b24d43\\n\\nMystery didnt help Tether this week. With news that they are backed by undisclosed reserves, well that brought them just a slight growth rate, still enough to grab at least a point. Some may arguing that Uniswap is to centralized, but nonetheless, Uniswap managed to get a good amount of points this week with a pretty looking growth rate. \\n\\n**XRP vs. Bitcoin Cash**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ubz1hncqm5r61.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57517d0ba96cf64fd66bb582a5c7747fd2948555\\n\\nXRP and SEC, what a love story that is this year. XRP is now worth more today than before the SEC lawsuit, interesting! This week they are back on track, even though they lost this match, they will be happy to grab some valuable points. \\n\\n**Ethereum vs. NEM**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/apbr45zrm5r61.png?width=483&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12bdf781bdcb06dae4d032da1133ceac47bb863e\\n\\nThis week was a good one. Ethereum fans are happy and they finally played a great game and managed to achieve massive gains this week. Ethereum is looking to extend this form also next week and keep on hoping that April is the start of the Altcoin season that everybody was waiting for.

Game Week 4 results and League Table! Welcome to the fourth week of the **CRYPTO FANTASY LEAGUE** called **MOONLEAGUE.** \\n\\nOnce again, you can read the rules here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m0ceaa/if\\_crypto\\_was\\_a\\_sport\\_league\\_and\\_coins\\_a\\_team/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m0ceaa/if_crypto_was_a_sport_league_and_coins_a_team/)\\n\\nThe results from **GAME WEEK 3** are here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mft6nn/week\\_3\\_crypto\\_fantasy\\_league\\_game\\_week\\_3\\_results/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mft6nn/week_3_crypto_fantasy_league_game_week_3_results/)\\n\\nAltcoin season is here! Many teams could enjoy this week as almost all teams gained some valuable points. Growth points are here, and this season is getting spicy. There was some serious movement, and a couple of interesting results. \\n\\nBefore I present the results, here is also one important update, in the next week I will work on a subreddit called: Moonleague. Everybody who wants to follow the results or share some info during game week you are free to do so. Once the subreddit is ready I will inform you with a post. \\n\\nHere are the GAME WEEK 4 results: \\n\\n**Crypto.com vs. Cosmos**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s9ez93elm5r61.png?width=483&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4277a8497e883f484d372b8fca973cf636fdc725\\n\\nThis was a tight game. Crypto.com gained some valuable points this week with Visa piloting the capability with Crypto.com. Cosmos was also pretty active, as they launched IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication), and that are good news for the team. They have managed to get some nice growth points but it was a close battle, and Crypto.com took the victory this week \\n\\n**Tether vs. Uniswap**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/80wp9afom5r61.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56a621cc22fe099dcad72b956869a4bdb3b24d43\\n\\nMystery didnt help Tether this week. With news that they are backed by undisclosed reserves, well that brought them just a slight growth rate, still enough to grab at least a point. Some may arguing that Uniswap is to centralized, but nonetheless, Uniswap managed to get a good amount of points this week with a pretty looking growth rate. \\n\\n**XRP vs. Bitcoin Cash**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ubz1hncqm5r61.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57517d0ba96cf64fd66bb582a5c7747fd2948555\\n\\nXRP and SEC, what a love story that is this year. XRP is now worth more today than before the SEC lawsuit, interesting! This week they are back on track, even though they lost this match, they will be happy to grab some valuable points. \\n\\n**Ethereum vs. NEM**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/apbr45zrm5r61.png?width=483&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12bdf781bdcb06dae4d032da1133ceac47bb863e\\n\\nThis week was a good one. Ethereum fans are happy and they finally played a great game and managed to achieve massive gains this week. Ethereum is looking to extend this form also next week and keep on hoping that April is the start of the Altcoin season that everybody was waiting for. NEM didnt had any chance this week, but at least they managed to get some growth points out of this, they still need a miracle in the next weeks to stand a chance for a decent spot in the league. \\n\\n**Binance Coin vs. USD Coin** \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xt690mwtm5r61.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0120510bddb533ff55fc1046afb4f3412330dda1\\n\\nBinance did a fantastic job this week, and they pulled out a wonderful growth rate, making them a serious contender for a play-off spot.

According to Refinitiv, **the new expectations point the federal funds rate to a new target range of 3.80% to 4.20% by end of 2022, with a peak of 3.94% ? 4.45% around March 2023.**\\n\\nOverall, the crypto market sentiment (measured by Crypto Fear &amp; Greed Index) continues to stand at **21/100, indicating Extreme Fear**, compared to a month ago when the Index stood at 29/100. The total crypto market cap had dropped by almost 10%, crossing below the $1 trillion mark. ETH dominance slightly dropped to 18% (from 20.5%) and Bitcoin went slightly up to 39.4%. As we had pointed out in our previous week?s macro analysis, the ETH Merge was a typical buy-the-rumour-sell-the-news event. The Protocol?s technical upgrade had already been priced in.\\n\\n**WATCH OUT FOR:** The next monetary policy meetings are scheduled for September 20-21st, 2022 for the FED and October 27th, 2022, for the ECB. The next US CPI release for September 2022 is scheduled for October 13th, 2022. The next US GDP update will be released on September 29th, 2022, followed by October 27th. 2022.", "level_1": 1, "level_2": null, "level_3": null, "datatype": "Objective"}

That would really surprise me. In 10 years, can a chain that enables entirely new important privacy oriented use cases have a market cap of a mere $10B? In TEN FUCKING YEARS? That's $1 ROSE. But realistically by then I think the mcap will be in the hundreds of billions of dollars, partly due to inflation but largely due to crypto adoption being in near full force by then.

I'd look at this as a tl;dr of \"network succeeds - you win, network loses - token is worthless to you\", but if the network doesn't succeed the token will be worthless anyway. Additionally, I could see a world where validators are trying to accumulate bigger stacks to process more jobs and get a larger % of the network fees and so DO start paying a share of transaction fees to anyone staking with them.

{"title": "", "selftext": "Bitcoin is a digital currency, with coin in its name, and the original White Paper describes it as electronic cash and mentions wallets. So people may assume when payments are made, coins move from address to address, from wallet to wallet. This is not at all how Bitcoin works, the coins and wallets analogy is just that, an analogy.\\n\\n###How cryptocurrency blockchains actually work\\n\\nSuppose Alice wants to send One Bitcoin (BTC) to Bob\\n\\n- First she composes a new transaction message which reference the funds in her wallet. These funds are composed of a combination of some of her previous transactions. These are known as the inputs. The sum of the inputs must total exactly or almost invariably more than the amount (due to fees), the amount she wants to send to Bob. \\n\\n- She must also note the address or public key to which she wants to send funds. These are called outputs. She signs the transaction message with her private keys corresponding to the input addresses and broadcasts it on the peer-to-peer network. \\n\\n- Its unlikely that Alice will have a single prior transaction that she can use to pay Bob (i.e. 1.01 BTC, exactly one bitcoin plus the appropriate mining fee). More likely she will have many different possible unspent outputs to choose from 0.87 - 0.34 - 1.15 - 3.5 - 0.02 - 0.001 - To make a payment she must combine these funds in such a way that she makes the correct payment to Bob. \\n\\n- So, she could use one big input (like the one for 3.5 bitcoins) and get change of 2.49 bitcoins back by including a second output for that amount to an address that she controls. The transaction would now have one input and two outputs.\\n\\n- Alternatively she could use two small inputs (like the ones for 0.87 and 0.34) but still want change (i.e. 0.2) for which she would provide a change address. That transaction would therefore have two inputs and two outputs.\\n\\n- If all goes well, a miner will include the transaction in the next block after verifying that the inputs and signatures are valid. The transaction is now complete and Bob can now reference this completed transaction as an input into a future transaction when he wants to move his funds.\\n\\nThe key thing to realize is that there are no individual, atomic units of bitcoin that are transferred among addresses. What individuals own are not bitcoins, but unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) that can serve as inputs for new transactions.\\n\\n###Why is this important to understand? Not your keys not your wallet!\\n\\nBecause it is not possible to track individual units of bitcoin, many legal questions of criminal activity and regulation (notably taxable events) are raised. Governments, law enforcement or criminals, can not track individual coins and instead concentrate on wallet addresses. When interacting with cryptocurrency blockchains - the addresses are the keys, literally and metaphorically, to ownership, security and privacy.\\n\\n###TL;DR There is no such thing as a Bitcoin. You do not store coins in a wallet - you keep a reference to records of your unspent transactions as a public key on the blockchain, which only your private key allow you to access (the crypto in cryptocurrency). Any payments and receipts, are updated as inputs and outputs, whose values, addresses and signatures are validated and verified by miners with the minting of new blocks, and secured onto the blockchain.\\n\\n(Any suggestions with wording or accuracy appreciated).\\n\\n[.](https://steemitimages.com/DQmbzafySPxgvggvABzDy9Lh2QR78kvCrwSApPiJKfDh5i4/what-is-blockchain-the-technology-explained.jpg)\\n\\nSome key information is sourced from an original article by Jerry Brito, Coin Center", "MAIN": "introducing payments and transactions - how cryptocurrency blockchains work in the simplest terms. bitcoin is a digital currency, with coin in its name, and the original white paper describes it as electronic cash and mentions wallets. so people may assume when payments are made, coins move from address to address, from wallet to wallet. this is not at all how bitcoin works, the coins and wallets analogy is just that, an analogy.\\n\\n###how cryptocurrency blockchains actually work\\n\\nsuppose alice wants to send one bitcoin (btc) to bob\\n\\n- first she composes a new transaction message which reference the funds in her wallet. these funds are composed of a combination of some of her previous transactions. these are known as the inputs. the sum of the inputs must total exactly or almost invariably more than the amount (due to fees), the amount she wants to send to bob. \\n\\n- she must also note the address or public key to which she wants to send funds. these are called outputs. she signs the transaction message with her private keys corresponding to the input addresses and broadcasts it on the peer-to-peer network. \\n\\n- its unlikely that alice will have a single prior transaction that she can use to pay bob (i.e. 1.01 btc, exactly one bitcoin plus the appropriate mining fee). more likely she will have many different possible unspent outputs to choose from 0.87 - 0.34 - 1.15 - 3.5 - 0.02 - 0.001 - to make a payment she must combine these funds in such a way that she makes the correct payment to bob. \\n\\n- so, she could use one big input (like the one for 3.5 bitcoins) and get change of 2.49 bitcoins back by including a second output for that amount to an address that she controls. the transaction would now have one input and two outputs.\\n\\n- alternatively she could use two small inputs (like the ones for 0.87 and 0.34) but still want change (i.e. 0.2) for which she would provide a change address. that transaction would therefore have two inputs and two outputs.\\n\\n- if all goes well, a miner will include the transaction in the next block after verifying that the inputs and signatures are valid. the transaction is now complete and bob can now reference this completed transaction as an input into a future transaction when he wants to move his funds.\\n\\nthe key thing to realize is that there are no individual, atomic units of bitcoin that are transferred among addresses. what individuals own are not bitcoins, but unspent transaction outputs (utxos) that can serve as inputs for new transactions.\\n\\n###why is this important to understand? not your keys not your wallet!\\n\\nbecause it is not possible to track individual units of bitcoin, many legal questions of criminal activity and regulation (notably taxable events) are raised. governments, law enforcement or criminals, can not track individual coins and instead concentrate on wallet addresses. when interacting with cryptocurrency blockchains - the addresses are the keys, literally and metaphorically, to ownership, security and privacy.\\n\\n###tl;dr there is no such thing as a bitcoin. you do not store coins in a wallet - you keep a reference to records of your unspent transactions as a public key on the blockchain, which only your private key allow you to access (the crypto in cryptocurrency). any payments and receipts, are updated as inputs and outputs, whose values, addresses and signatures are validated and verified by miners with the minting of new blocks, and secured onto the blockchain.\\n\\n(any suggestions with wording or accuracy appreciated).\\n\\n[.]( key information is sourced from an original article by jerry brito, coin center", "level_1": 2, "level_2": 0, "level_3": 0, "datatype": "Neutral sentiment"}

{"title": "", "selftext": "The environmental arguments against BTC have gained alot of traction in recent months - the basic construction is that Bitcoin uses ALOT of electricity for a low transaction throughput.  I will start by saying that I have alot of issue with self proclaimed environmentalists in both their assessment of and solutions to the problem of human impact on the worlds climate / environment, but I do think it is clear that human activity is having a detrimental effect on the planet and that there are things that can (and ought to) be done to improve that situation.  Additionally, I will say that any changes that can reduce the environmental impact of Bitcoin (or other proof of work assets) are worthwhile... I expect that these improvements are more likely to be related to \"cleaner\" electricity generation processes than changes to the BTC protocol itself.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nNow, to the real question at hand - why would I believe that BTC even in it's current state is a net positive for the environment?  The answer here simply boils down to the nature of deflationary units of account vs. inflationary ones.  World governments are currently in a dick measuring competition with each other over GDP... measured in how much useless shit gets cranked out and consumed on an annual basis.  If people start drinking water and stop drinking Coca-Cola... well they just lost an inch.

Even in this sub it is often mentioned that nobody would buy a coke with BTC because the BTC might be worth more tomorrow... and that's EXACTLY the point.  Today... why wouldn't I buy a coke now when I know I can only buy half a coke in 4 years... this encourages the consumerist orgy to continue, don't save anything for the future, use it now before it's worth less.  With BTC when I look at that Coke i can say... do I want 1 coke now, or 2 in 4 years (the rate of future value increase does decline as adoption increases, but due to the deflationary nature of Bitcoin I am always incentivized to delay consumption as long as possible).  To be clear... my Coke consumption wouldn't drop to 0... but it does go way down.. I am still going to buy everything I need now (housing, food, etc.), and a few luxuries here and there... but overall, I am incentivized to consume less and entertain myself in other ways.  This is GOOD for the environment, and for human impact on the planet.  Why are we all rushing to buy that new Iphone with an improvement in picture quality you'd need an electron microscope to observe? because why not... it's not like delaying the purchase till my old phone breaks earns me anything.

It was sort of a Play to Win type of game and I wanted to be super OP but in order to do so I had to purchase things with real money. As a freshman in high school with no job and no money, I begged my parents to get this one thing for me but still they said no. I didn't give up though.

Just get some Bitcoin, convert that into in game currency, and booya I get insane stat boosted armor. My dad decided to help me out with this venture and we looked into how we could get Bitcoin and saw that Ebay users were selling Bitcoin for \"I think\" $80 a coin. But after thorough research my dad and I found that \"mining\" was another way to get free Bitcoin. There were already great YouTube tutorials on how mining can be done, but I had a super crappy laptop so there was no way I could mine on such a thing and my parents would never get me a $500 graphic card and computer.

{"title": "", "selftext": "**What is Decentralized Gambling and How Does it Differ From Centralized one?**\\n\\nOnline gambling has been a massive industry in many countries around the world for the past decade, especially considering that various large companies have played their part in this expansion. Recently, however, a new form of online betting has begun to emerge alongside the ever-increasing relevance of cryptocurrency: decentralized gambling.\\n\\nAt its core, decentralized gambling is about reducing the custodial element of online gambing, with shorter waiting times for processes such as registration, deposit and withdrawal of funds, as well as giving the player more control over their own funds when gambling. This makes decentralized gabling more appetible to many users who are passionate about gambling. That being said there are also a few downsides to it. Lets start by addressing in full what decentralized gambling actually means.\\n\\n**How does decentralized gambling work?**\\n\\nDecentralized gambling is essentially a method of gambling that provides a mechanism for players to attach their cryptocurrency wallets to the operator website, therefore giving them full control over their funds at all times. These wallets are linked to blockchain technology which is the key to offering the decentralized gambling industry with security, privacy and cost-effectiveness. This is in part due to the fact that the blockchain database creates a decentralized digital and chronological record of all transactions that take place. This serves both casino operators and players well because it increases confidence in transactions that do not need to be analyzed by a third party in order to ensure fairness.\\n\\n**The main differences between decentralized and centralized gambling**\\n\\nAs stated above, the main difference is that rather than being stored on a centralized server, decentralized gambling applications are stored on a cryptos blockchain. But what does that mean for the actual lived experience of the player? First of all, they are not dependent on gambling operators for processes and formalities such as deposits and receiving their winnings, like they would be in a normal online casino. \\n\\nWith crypto gambling, there is no central authority, meaning that players have full liberty on their transactions (deposits, withdrawals and fund distributions) which are, again, recorded, transparent and open to all. Players therefore do not face delays in receiving their winnings, which in decentralized gambling are released immediately by smart contracts.\\n\\nAnother key difference is anonymity. In centralized online casinos, players must open accounts by inserting personal details like name, address, as well as usually having to provide photo ID and a copy of credit cards. Such compliances are unnecessary in decentralized gambling as players gamble through their unique wallet address and only have to provide a name and email address.\\n\\n**The link between blockchain and security**\\n\\nAs previously implied, an elevated degree of security is one of the main attractions that decentralized gambling can offer. This is primarily due to the fact that this form of betting depends on cryptocurrency transactions. The lack of a centralized authority or third-party verification enables players to have full liberty over their transactions and ensures that there are almost no chances of fraud occurring. \\n\\nThis happens because all movements, including withdrawals, deposits and other fund distributions, are recorded on an instrument called the distributed ledger technology (DLT) of the blockchain, and are furthermore processed by smart contracts that can be accessed and surveyed by anyone at any time, giving the process the utmost level of transparency.\\n\\n[https://decentralizedgambling.io/](https://decentralizedgambling.io/)", "MAIN": "decentralized v/s centralized gambling **what is decentralized gambling and how does it differ from centralized one?**\\n\\nonline gambling has been a massive industry in many countries around the world for the past decade, especially considering that various large companies have played their part in this expansion. recently, however, a new form of online betting has begun to emerge alongside the ever-increasing relevance of cryptocurrency: decentralized gambling.\\n\\nat its core, decentralized gambling is about reducing the custodial element of online gambing, with shorter waiting times for processes such as registration, deposit and withdrawal of funds, as well as giving the player more control over their own funds when gambling. this makes decentralized gabling more appetible to many users who are passionate about gambling. that being said there are also a few downsides to it. lets start by addressing in full what decentralized gambling actually means.\\n\\n**how does decentralized gambling work?**\\n\\ndecentralized gambling is essentially a method of gambling that provides a mechanism for players to attach their cryptocurrency wallets to the operator website, therefore giving them full control over their funds at all times. these wallets are linked to blockchain technology which is the key to offering the decentralized gambling industry with security, privacy and cost-effectiveness. this is in part due to the fact that the blockchain database creates a decentralized digital and chronological record of all transactions that take place. this serves both casino operators and players well because it increases confidence in transactions that do not need to be analyzed by a third party in order to ensure fairness.\\n\\n**the main differences between decentralized and centralized gambling**\\n\\nas stated above, the main difference is that rather than being stored on a centralized server, decentralized gambling applications are stored on a cryptos blockchain. but what does that mean for the actual lived experience of the player? first of all, they are not dependent on gambling operators for processes and formalities such as deposits and receiving their winnings, like they would be in a normal online casino. \\n\\nwith crypto gambling, there is no central authority, meaning that players have full liberty on their transactions (deposits, withdrawals and fund distributions) which are, again, recorded, transparent and open to all. players therefore do not face delays in receiving their winnings, which in decentralized gambling are released immediately by smart contracts.\\n\\nanother key difference is anonymity. in centralized online casinos, players must open accounts by inserting personal details like name, address, as well as usually having to provide photo id and a copy of credit cards. such compliances are unnecessary in decentralized gambling as players gamble through their unique wallet address and only have to provide a name and email address.\\n\\n**the link between blockchain and security**\\n\\nas previously implied, an elevated degree of security is one of the main attractions that decentralized gambling can offer. this is primarily due to the fact that this form of betting depends on cryptocurrency transactions. the lack of a centralized authority or third-party verification enables players to have full liberty over their transactions and ensures that there are almost no chances of fraud occurring. \\n\\nthis happens because all movements, including withdrawals, deposits and other fund distributions, are recorded on an instrument called the distributed ledger technology (dlt) of the blockchain, and are furthermore processed by smart contracts that can be accessed and surveyed by anyone at any time, giving the process the utmost level of transparency.\\n\\n[", "level_1": 2, "level_2": 0, "level_3": 0, "datatype": "Neutral sentiment"}

Many questions to be answered in clear here. Is it okay when 90% of mining power in Bitcoin [can gather in one room](https://twitter.com/lopp/status/673398201307664384)? Is it okay when 2 or 3 mining pools control majority of hashing power, so can do censorship? Is it okay when almost all the new nodes avoid processing a blockchain from its genesis block? Is it okay when a Proof-of-Work coin developers are doing a hard-fork changing the consensus algorithm to make it GPU-friendly again? Can we summarize all the issues with decentralization? Can we cover most of issues with technical means?Decentralization is about many issues lying in many fields, of technical, social, and hybrid kinds. Researchers and developers are trying to find technical solutions, preferably, elegant and efficient. However, for many issues such solutions are not known, thus social solutions are also needed.In this article I will cover only technical aspects of decentralization, namely, decentralization of mining and decentralization of verification.## Decentralization of MiningThe two biggest concerns about decentralization of mining are specialized hardware (such as ASICs) and centralized pools.With ASICs, a big player capable to invest enough money into R;D can get unfair advantage from privately owned efficient hardware. In principle, for any kind of computational activity it is always possible to develop specialized hardware performing better than commodity computing units, such and CPUs and GPUs. However, for different computational tasks R;D efforts and possible outcome could vary a lot. Reasoning behind a search for a perfect (or close enough to perfect) could be quite complex (see e.g. 30 pages long [Equihash paper](http://ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger/article/view/48)).For most of Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies (including Bitcoin, Ethereum, ZCash), 2 to 4 centralized mining pools  control majority of mining power. This could mean easy censorship or frontrunning on applications (for example, reordering exchange orders), as in centralized pools only pool decides block candidate for the whole pool to work on. As a possible outcome, non-outsourceable mining schemes can prevent centralized pools formation. Only [Ergo Platform](https://ergoplatform.org/en/) is known for deploying a practical non-outsourceable Proof-of-Work scheme (based on a supposedly memory-harder problem from the [Equihash paper](http://ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger/article/view/48)) called [Autolykos](https://docs.ergoplatform.com/ErgoPow.pdf).As an example where social decentralization issues meet the decentralization of mining, sometimes developers of Proof-of-Work are introducing hard-forks to make a Proof-of-Work algorithm GPU-friendly again once ASICs are going to dominate in the mining market for the coin, however, it is always not quite clear why totally legit activity is banned and why developers (along with some users) can do hard-fork for this particular reason.## Decentralization of VerificationDecentralization of verification is about possibility to check validity of blockchain history. Such check provides confidence that nothing bad (i.e not conforming to a protocol) was injected to the blockchain and thus give a user a right to reject malicious chain even if it has absorbed more work than alternatives. There were many talks about such the right in the Bitcoin community when it was partly hot about User-Activated Soft Fork (UASF) idea, and recent article [Who secures Bitcoin?\"](https://medium.com/@BitcoinErrorLog/who-secures-bitcoin-95b19bbcda3c) is summarizing this way of thinking well.If verification can be done in reasonable time only by an entity able to spend millions on renting a datacenter, obviously a network is not decentralized. Ideally, it should be possible to check integrity of the whole blockchain on commodity hardware, like a decent laptop.However, new blockchains also tend to absorb more and more features, and they are not coming for free. Then the huge topic in the research community is about how to make possible to check integrity of the whole blockchain with pruned blocks or system state (or both) under plausible assumptions. Possible solutions here are about bootstrapping state snapshot and blockchain suffix on top of it (popular in Ethereum protocol clients, and formalized in [an academic paper even](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/129.pdf)), stateless clients ([partially stateless](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/994), as implemented in [Ergo Platform](https://ergoplatform.org/en/) or [fully stateless](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/968) which do exist only in research papers currently).", "MAIN": "A New Quest for Decentralization  [https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019\\_12\\_12\\_new\\_quest/](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_12_12_new_quest/)  https://preview.redd.it/f44p1dg7jpd41.jpg?width=850;format=pjpg;auto=webp;s=49471e04d4d55450f70b5ca450f667e62fc6f354While most active conversations today in the space are about wider adoption of the blockchain technology (which often means selling out to the Wall St.) and competition with systems like Visa and Mastercard (which often means giving up with decentralization or introducing unclear security assumptions in the name of efficiency), there is the obvious need to revisit the roots of the cryptocurrency movement, which are mostly about decentralization.

Reasoning behind a search for a perfect (or close enough to perfect) could be quite complex (see e.g. 30 pages long [Equihash paper](http://ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger/article/view/48)).For most of Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies (including Bitcoin, Ethereum, ZCash), 2 to 4 centralized mining pools  control majority of mining power. This could mean easy censorship or frontrunning on applications (for example, reordering exchange orders), as in centralized pools only pool decides block candidate for the whole pool to work on. As a possible outcome, non-outsourceable mining schemes can prevent centralized pools formation. Only [Ergo Platform](https://ergoplatform.org/en/) is known for deploying a practical non-outsourceable Proof-of-Work scheme (based on a supposedly memory-harder problem from the [Equihash paper](http://ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger/article/view/48)) called [Autolykos](https://docs.ergoplatform.com/ErgoPow.pdf).As an example where social decentralization issues meet the decentralization of mining, sometimes developers of Proof-of-Work are introducing hard-forks to make a Proof-of-Work algorithm GPU-friendly again once ASICs are going to dominate in the mining market for the coin, however, it is always not quite clear why totally legit activity is banned and why developers (along with some users) can do hard-fork for this particular reason.## Decentralization of VerificationDecentralization of verification is about possibility to check validity of blockchain history. Such check provides confidence that nothing bad (i.e not conforming to a protocol) was injected to the blockchain and thus give a user a right to reject malicious chain even if it has absorbed more work than alternatives. There were many talks about such the right in the Bitcoin community when it was partly hot about User-Activated Soft Fork (UASF) idea, and recent article [Who secures Bitcoin?\"](https://medium.com/@BitcoinErrorLog/who-secures-bitcoin-95b19bbcda3c) is summarizing this way of thinking well.If verification can be done in reasonable time only by an entity able to spend millions on renting a datacenter, obviously a network is not decentralized. Ideally, it should be possible to check integrity of the whole blockchain on commodity hardware, like a decent laptop.However, new blockchains also tend to absorb more and more features, and they are not coming for free. Then the huge topic in the research community is about how to make possible to check integrity of the whole blockchain with pruned blocks or system state (or both) under plausible assumptions. Possible solutions here are about bootstrapping state snapshot and blockchain suffix on top of it (popular in Ethereum protocol clients, and formalized in [an academic paper even](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/129.pdf)), stateless clients ([partially stateless](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/994), as implemented in [Ergo Platform](https://ergoplatform.org/en/) or [fully stateless](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/968) which do exist only in research papers currently).", "level_1": 2, "level_2": 0, "level_3": 0, "datatype": "Neutral sentiment"}

Through this \"control\", both Bitcoin and Compound can create specific incentives for miners.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIn Bitcoin, the incentive is for miners to include and validate as many transactions as possible, while also requiring miners to keep mining at the top of the blockchain. In general, the mechanisms of positive workload, block producers, timestamps, and incentives make Bitcoin a trustless electronic cash system. Bitcoin requires miners to follow this specific strategy to secure the network, also known as Nakamoto Consensus.\\n\\nHowever, scholars such as Eyal published a paper in 2013 that Nakamoto consensus may not be perfect. He proposed a strategy called \"selfish mining\" (Selfish Mining), which can allow a few mining pools to obtain more money than they honestly perform mining. Mining protocol for more benefits.

Compound is able to do this because their liquidity miners have a lot of incentive strategies to choose from - after all users need to pay a certain amount of COMP tokens for (almost) any action they want to take in the Compound protocol.\\n\\nIn fact, the Compound protocol is designed this way because the priority of the Compound protocol is not to incentivize specific behaviors on the network (such as Bitcoin miners mining is a specific behavior, and they also earn BTC for mining Token Rewards), Compound's purpose is to provide tokens to a large number of users. Here, lets look at a counter-example: Synthetix, the DeFi protocol that uses its token SNX in a more targeted way. In order to defend the peg of the synthetic stablecoin SNX, the Synthetix protocol will provide incentives for those who add liquidity to the Dai/USDC/USDT/sUSD pool on Curve (i.e. \"liquidity providers\").\\n\\nHowever, for a period of time, BAT, the currency with the best COMP liquidity mining revenue, almost monopolized COMP mining. Generally speaking, the higher the deposit rate, the more efficient COMP mining will be, but miners will basically stick to the incentives as their share of the COMP token reward is based on the interest paid. Unilaterally increasing the scale of BAT deposits cannot increase the interest rate, because the factor that directly affects the interest rate is the loan ratio. As a result, large BAT users deposit other assets in their accounts, and continue to increase the scale of mortgage until all the previously deposited BAT is lent.

Indeed, Compound does not have a \"Nakamoto Consensus\" nor a strategy that miners are explicitly required to follow, and they may hope that at least some rewards will not be captured by anomalous strategies. Simple users who deposit USDC and USDT in Compound are like the easiest and most stable flow of funds in the existing banking system, anyway, a cryptocurrency system like Compound can \"attract\" billions of bank deposits Coming in was definitely a huge success.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nOf course, whether it is liquidity mining or positive workload, these mechanisms ultimately need to be weighed.

There's a better way to browse the /r/cryptocurrency subreddit! Here are some quick tips for not driving yourself insane navigating and interacting with this silly place.\\n\\n1. Sort by New\\n\\n In my opinion a lot of the best discussions on this subreddit are contained within smaller posts with a more narrow topic. Sort by new, and engage in these threads. Just because it's not going to hit the front page doesn't mean there is nothing to gain or share from smaller less popular threads. Especially if you have something to add! Just because a thread has 20 votes and only 10 comments doesn't mean the quality of information there is low. Quite the opposite as far as I've experienced.\\n\\n2. Ignore what doesn't interest you\\n\\nSick of the 20 doge or Elon posts per hour? Ignore them. Scroll past and pretend it's not there. Learn to skim the page and identify the topics you are here to discuss, or the news and information that grabs your interest. After a while it becomes instinct to zip past all the hot garbage and pick out the threads you like. Comments too.. just blast right past it. It won't get on your nerves if you don't stop to read it.\\n\\n3. Post when you are knowledgeable\\n\\nSee someone posting a misconception? Did someone ask a question you know the answer to? Is there something people are failing to bring up that you believe is important? Engage. Share, help new people or even vets that maybe don't know much about that specific topic. It usually does not go without appreciation. \\n\\n4. Share your perspective.\\n\\nOur most valuable resource here is your honest opinion. The more people we have choosing to engage and share their perspective, the less power shills, undue FUD, and undue FOMO have to sway the narrative. Don't be afraid to post something that you think might draw criticism, share your perspective so we can all get a more accurate picture of what people are thinking and feeling. Try not to be concerned about possible negative karma, even karmaless comments can spark a discussion and IMO that's a good thing. And remember that you don't have to have a debate in order to share perspectives with someone who disagrees with you. \\n\\n5. Post when you want to know more\\n\\nThere is no shame in asking a question. If someone(s) is talking about something you don't quite understand ask.. expand the conversation. I guarantee there are other people who had the same question that just won't ask.. It helps everyone to have deeper discussions.\\n\\n6. Be yourself\\n\\nI generally believe if more people were simply themselves on here the overall quality would improve. The more we engage honestly the better the experience will for all.. and I think the experience is better for the individual poster too.\\n\\n6b. Unless you're a complete dick\\n\\nThere is generally a fine balance between tolerable and intolerable levels of dickishness. Find your balance if you know that you can be abrasive.. unless you're a complete dick in which case you probably don't care so continue on. Most people won't have too much trouble with 6b and can disregard it.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\ntldr; Engage honestly, sort by new, and participate in smaller posts even though they won't shower you with moons and karma.

{"title": "", "selftext": "\\n\\n\\#What Is Monero (XMR)?\\n\\nMonero is just like every other crypto which makes it digital currency. The main difference between Monero and every other Cryptocurrency is the fact that Monero is fungible and can't be linked to any user or identity. The term fungible refers to a currency where every unit is identical and mutually interchangeable with another unit of the same value. So Bitcoin received from the illegal transaction can be distinguished from a Bitcoin bought on Coinbase or Binance through blockchain analysis, two separate Monero coins transacted from darknet or Binance appear exactly the same and can't be distinguished. This is the reason financial regulators can trace Bitcoin transactions but not XMR payments.\\n\\n\\#How Does Monero (XMR) Work?\\n\\nMonero is able to maintain privacy and anonymity through these two important processes: Stealth addresses and Ring signature\\n\\nStealth addresses allow the sender to create a public address on behalf of the recipient for every single transaction. So every transaction is able to create its own public address to maintain privacy and anonymity. Every Monero user can generate a private view key and a private spend key. The private view key allows the user to see transactions within their account but is unable to transact with it. While the private spend key allows them to authorize payments and transactions\\n\\nRing signatures is a concept from cryptography which means that the signature can be signed by any member of a specific group of people who possess private keys. Every time someone makes a XMR transaction, the Monero wallet forms a ring from other users' keys it pulls from the blockchain. It makes it impossible for people observing which and whose keys were being used to sign. Furthermore, in January 2017, Monero introduced RingCT which hides the value of transactions.\\n\\n\\#What Makes Monero (XMR) Unique?\\n\\nMonero has anonymous developers and open-source code. It may sound similar to Bitcoin but there are major differences, most notably by the way updates and forks are handled. Monero's software is programmed to update every six months autonomously unlike Bitcoin which is somewhat reluctant when it comes to forks or updates.\\n\\nFor Monero users, the value of Monero comes from its privacy and anonymity. It liberates Monero users to transact whenever and for whatever reason they want without being able to be observed by anyone. In addition to that, a lot of its investors believe that demand for privacy will increase over time and drive up the price of the XMR itself.\\n\\n\\#What Is the Supply of Monero (XMR)?\\n\\nMonero (XMR) currently has a circulating supply of 18,004,702 XMR. It will reach a total supply of 18.4 million XMR by May 2022.

{"title": "", "selftext": "I made a series of uninformed decisions that I thought I someone should know about. I'm mostly posting this as a warning to other newbies, but maybe someone could teach me something.\\n\\nInspired by the sudden explosion in investing early this year, I began my journey into buying crypto. I was smart enough to avoid using Robinhood, but otherwise I was just bright eyed and bushy tailed entering a world I didn't know very well. I started with a few small purchases on Coinbase. I bought some small amounts of BTC, some ETH, and some XLM based on very light research. I even bought like 5 XTZ at some point after being impressed by their mission.\\n\\nAt some point it seemed like the general consensus was to put those in a wallet to keep them safe. \"Not your keys, not your coins,\" right? **This might have been my first mistake.** I used the Coinbase wallet and quickly learned about the fees for transferring. My $100 ETH turned in $70 just that quickly. And if I want to put it back on the exchange? I'd be lucky to end up with $50 in ETH.\\n\\nTransferring XLM was much less expensive. After learning about the cheaper fees on Coinbase Pro, I decided I would pull the XLM out of my wallet and put it on Coinbase Pro to play around with. **This was my second mistake.** To transfer XLM, you need to include a memo. Forgetting the memo, my XLM completed the transfer, but it sure as hell wasn't on my Coinbase Pro account. After contacting Coinbase Pro, they quickly told me to transfer an exact amount of XLM from the wallet back to the Coinbase Pro exchange in order to confirm my transaction and get my original XLM back. I bought a little bit more XLM, attempted the transfer with that exact amount (and a memo this time) only to have this XLM disappear as well. It has been almost a month, and Coinbase Support still has not responded to my repeated inquiries.\\n\\nFeeling both stupid and cheated, I decided to go elsewhere for crypto. I made my way over to Kraken and deposited my small amount of XTZ. After the Filecoin double deposit debacle, I thought I'd take a chance converting my XTZ to Siacoin. I'm happy with that decision, but Kraken is not as user friendly as Coinbase. **This was my third mistake.** I didn't research Kraken as well, and it appears I cannot link it directly to my bank account. Neither Coinbase nor Binance.us support SIA, so the only way I can think to get it out is convert it (fees), transfer it (fees), then sell it (fees). I'm not even sure if I have enough to even cover that amount.\\n\\nNow I technically own a diverse portfolio, but the amounts are so small I can't really do anything with it. I have an amount of ETH that I can't realistically move from one wallet, some XLM that disappeared into nothingness, some SIA that might as well be imaginary, and hell, I even purchased a small amount of BNB on Binance. It might all total an amount that would cover a month of rent, but at this point it's so spread out that I can't realistically recover that much from it.\\n\\nI'm not too upset, and this has all been a learning experience, but I hope others can learn from my mistakes. If you're planning to buy a good amount and hold long term, just stuff it in a wallet and forget it. And if you want to trade it back and forth and sell it quickly, and exchange is great.

{"title": "", "selftext": "There is a lot of advice for beginners that are new to crypto, but what about advice for long term holders?\\n\\nHere my five hacks:\\n\\n1. Dont HODL forever. Take at least your initial investment out and keep it in Fiat and wait for the next dip or crash.\\n2. Dont use stablecoins for too long. If you are waiting for a dip or bear market, dont leave a huge amount of money in stablecoins, especiallys USDT. You never know what happens during a big crash and if your stablecoin is safe or wont crash too. If you dont daytrade and you are waiting for a good entry point, just change the money back to fiat - and transfer it to your bank account, dont leave it on an exchange.\\n3. Dont get lazy with security. At least two or three times a year open you Nano ledger or whatever you use, just see how and if it works, check where your seed phrase is stored. Reconsider if its the best way to store it. If you got a lot of money on it, you might wanna store it in a safe, perhaps even in a bank safe. Also: Did you brag about your crypto gains? Who knows where your seed phrase is? Your wife? Is she still your wife, or your ex who wants money? Do your friends know, or could they know? Just print a new seed phrase and store it somewhere else from year to year.\\n4. Dont miss new opportunities. We all have our favourite coins and perhaps you bought them years ago and just watch them growing, but dont be lazy to do research and search for new opportunities.

{"title": "", "selftext": "Disclaimer:  this is not meant as general advice, this is a strategy I'm sharing  which may appeal to some people. If you don't trust a centralized  exchange (like Binance) with your funds, please ignore this post.\\n\\nContrary to  common belief, buy-and-hold is not the \"least risky\" way to invest. You  can have tighter control over downside-risk by trading Futures.\\n\\nFutures  trading offers leverage up to 100x, which is why it's considered  extremely risky. However, you can lower the leverage all the way down to  1x (no leverage), while enjoying features that are unique to the  Futures platform.\\n\\nI'm talking  about the ability to set a stop-loss. It's very intuitive, you just  enter the price you want your position to be sold at (you can change  this price afterwards, and you'll be shown how many $ you lose if your  position is sold at a given price).\\n\\n\\-------\\n\\nExample of how you can stay in the game without being exposed to a huge market correction:\\n\\nYou  have $1000. You want to invest in BTC or DOT or whatever.  When you buy your desired coin, you set the stop-loss at a  price 20% below the current price.

Here are the results.\\n\\n**Numbers &amp; assumptions:**\\n\\n* DCAing takes place every week, on 1st, 8th, 15th and 22th of every month starting from Jan 1st 2015 and until July 6th 2021.\\n* Investments budget per week is $100.\\n* The weekly investment is divided equally on the coins invested in.\\n* This case study is ignoring stable coin investments. E.g.: investing in the top 5 coins means the top 5 coins excluding any stable coins.\\n* The analysis is assuming that you invested your money and never sold any coin till now.\\n* Total invested money over the whole DCA period is $31,300.\\n* Transaction fees are not included in the analysis.\\n\\n**Here are the results:**\\n\\n* If you blindly DCA into the top 1 coins (BTC), you will end up with **$1,102,104**.\\n* If you blindly DCA into the top 2 coins, you will end up with 4 coins (BTC, XRP, LTC, ETH) in your wallet and total worth of **$1,462,443**.\\n* If you blindly DCA into the **top 3 coins**, you will end up with 11 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,310,552.**\\n* If you blindly DCA into the **top 5 coins**, you will end up with 23 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,490,189.**\\n* If you blindly DCA into the **top 7 coins**, you will end up with 37 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,923,849.**\\n* If you blindly DCA into the **top 10 coins**, you will end up with 55 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,316,169.**\\n* If you blindly DCA into the **top 20 coins**, you will end up with 130 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,619,756.**\\n* If you blindly DCA into the **top 50 coins**, you will end up with 381 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$979,086.**\\n* If you had a glass ball and knew that ETH will be what it's today and you invested only in BTC &amp; ETH, you will end up with 2 coins in your wallet (surprise), and a total worth of **$4,505,477.**\\n\\n**Some observations:**\\n\\n1. Although it was relatively easier to guess that BTC will be the #1 crypto coin back then, nobody would have guessed for sure that ETH will be #2, so betting on BTC &amp; ETH only from the beginning would've been your strategy only if you know the future. (you are God). Based on that it's safer to say \"I invest in the top X coins\" instead of saying I only invest in coin X and coin Y.\\n2. Investing in altcoins in addition to BTC can increase your ROI considerably. Investing in top 7-10 coins tends to yield the most return in this case study (x3).\\n3. Based on #2, a crypto ETF (or a similar service from exchanges that allow us to buy in bulk) could give exposure to the top X coins while saving transaction costs considerably.\\n\\nIf you want more details, here is what your wallet would look like in each case of the above:\\n\\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-aRmJBZlb9azXHODN3WFkIVzwxepH3GV/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-aRmJBZlb9azXHODN3WFkIVzwxepH3GV/view?usp=sharing), [https://drive.google.com/file/d/12v45\\_cy4hNSiEklZj042SDsgfnKObr4i/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12v45_cy4hNSiEklZj042SDsgfnKObr4i/view?usp=sharing), [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EwFvusdGrOVdagvXqAXrAw0BTUZmKowG/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EwFvusdGrOVdagvXqAXrAw0BTUZmKowG/view?usp=sharing), [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R8hZs7IYED8ksjyera37gWJLzRzcPAXE/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R8hZs7IYED8ksjyera37gWJLzRzcPAXE/view?usp=sharing), [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bRijSf8sZ9J3bIGBY-iiGAQjgbL-vPzu/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bRijSf8sZ9J3bIGBY-iiGAQjgbL-vPzu/view?usp=sharing), [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k4ONNzFqXJ96t9S2xKR8SD88VSMBXYim/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k4ONNzFqXJ96t9S2xKR8SD88VSMBXYim/view?usp=sharing), [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o\\_7Nd8TcyfkVS2-OUAvStObUjk-x4j0c/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o_7Nd8TcyfkVS2-OUAvStObUjk-x4j0c/view?usp=sharing), [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xIZv0DpMBO18LgHg-OFKo41WgHiYRFUf/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xIZv0DpMBO18LgHg-OFKo41WgHiYRFUf/view?usp=sharing), [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yGKbXeS6DZic6A1PmM5sGA2A3CZOyzUp/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yGKbXeS6DZic6A1PmM5sGA2A3CZOyzUp/view?usp=sharing)\\n\\nI**MPORTANT NOTE:** This whole case study was a fun project and i was trying to answer some questions and thought to share it with you in case that would help you in any way.

{"title": "", "selftext": "Hey folk,\\n\\nfirst things first. I'm fairly new to the crypto scene as well as to reddit as a network to have a discussion on. So please excuse my clumsy choice of words, if I'm using wrong terms in the following.\\n\\nI recently stumbled over the anchor protocol of the terra network, which offers various ways to invest money. Even so I'm very impressed with the project's idea, the names of the team and the amount of people already involved, I still have some doubts about how safe it is, to put my money there.\\n\\nSo as one of various options to stake your money (I will only talk about this one for now), the anchor protocol claims to guarantee 20 APR on the amount of UST that is being deposited. This sound like a crazy good deal regarding the APRs you would currently receive at a bank (at least here in Germany) which would be around 0.5 to 1.0 APR. So the question that springs to mind is, how is that even possible? Are there any catches?\\n\\nSo I tried to do a little digging (reddit, YouTube, google etc.). Sadly, none of what I found truly explained where the value was created in order to guarantee this 20 APR. Most of the posts took the 20% as good given or explained it with oversimplified examples that would just relocate the question about the creation of value to another part of the example.\\n\\nTo be fair, I was overstrained reading the white papers, since I m not familiar with IT-terms, as I never got in touch with programming too much. So maybe everything is laid out there and I'm just too stupid to understand it.\\n\\nAnyhow, the little bit if research I did today as well as the examples posted gave me the impression that the 20 APR is only working as long as the network is growing and we are moving in a bulls market. As I said before, I don't want to imply anything here, I just really hope, someone can give me a little deeply insight to understand the system.\\n\\nSo here is the given example that supposedly explains, how 20 APR can be maintained:\\n\\nFirst of all, its presumed that stacked UST can generate a yield of 10-12 APR (even tho I have no idea if that is realistic, I just assume its true since I see how stacking generates value by verifying transactions)\\n\\n1. Leo deposits 100 $, expects 20 APR = 20 $ for the year\\n2. Bob wants to borrow 100 $, so he puts down 300 $ dollar as collateral in order to take Leo's 100 $ as a loan\\n3. the anchor protocol stakes Bob#s 300 $ collateral to gain 30 $ ( 10 APR on 300 $)\\n4. From this staking earning (30 $), 20 $ go into Leo's pocket for providing the 100 $ loan, the other 10 $ go into some type of pool of the network\\n\\nSo why would you lock up 300 $ as collateral in order to loan 100 $. Why not work with 100 $ of the 300 $ of your own in the first place? Since the collateral deposited is locked in stacking, you don't get the 100 $ on top of your 300 $ to work with but instead.\\n\\nSince this doesn't make sense, I tried to figure out why people would loan from the depositors of UST. So apparently if you post bLuna as collateral, you get rewarded which anchor token with insane APR up to 250% (the YouTube video was from march this year). On top of that, you can loan money as states in the example before in order to add it to the collateral value already put down, leading to a bigger amount rewarded with the 250 APR.\\n\\nto amplify the example before:\\n\\n5. Bob gets 250 APR in anchor tokens for his 300 $ put down in collateral.\\n\\n6. He also get 250 APR on the 100 $ loaned from Leo. Therefore he does not mind to pay 30% interest on the 100 $ loaned (10% stacking reward on the 300 $ put down as collateral) since he is still making good profit with 220 APR on the loaned money.\\n\\nThis leads to the next and even more urgent question. Are these 250% legit?\\n\\nApparently the APR on the collateral value is flexibel, depending on the amount of collateral value as well as the demand for it.\\n\\nSo right now the value of an anchor token sits at around 5 dollars. If the prices stays the same, even with more and more value being put down as collateral, the APR in put down collateral value will dip but not go anywhere near 30 APR in the foreseeable future. If demand for the anchor token goes up, the APR might even rise. So for those scenarios, system keeps going.\\n\\nQuestion is: What happens if the value of anchor token goes down? Since the generated anchor token reward is self compounding and therefor put down as collateral value right away in order to general more anchor token, the \"value\" never really leaves the eco-system of the terra-network. I see the temptation of just putting all the profit right back in the collateral value, since 250% is simply too good to not throw all money spare money you have at it.\\n\\nBut what happens if someone actually started to cash out? I assume the price of anchor token would drop due to a drop in demand, the APR for collateral value would drop, therefore more people would get out, the value of anchor would drop even more, collateral loaned will be liquidated which all will eventually lead to a downward spiral.\\n\\nIt looks like the whole thing could go south pretty quickly, once rolling.\\n\\nSo this leads me to the final question where I want to leave it for now and see if anyone has some more information on this topic.\\n\\nWhat is the actual value of anchor and how stable is its value?\\n\\nSince its supposed to carry interest at 250 APR, is there any more value to it, other than being automatically reinvested as collateral value in order to general even more anchor? It seem that other the staking for interest you can also stake anchor tokens in order to participate in votes of the terra network community.\\n\\nSo this does not quite cut it for me in order to put my money here. The vote option aside. I don't see any value in anchor other than that it might be stacked in order to get more value. The whole system stops working, once the price of anchor drops and people cash out. Everyone not fast enough will lose money or even get liquidated. Since we're in a bull market and the \"auto compounding\" is very convenient, I don't see this happening anytime soon, but I guess it will eventually happen.\\n\\nI don't know if I'm making any mistakes here, if I'm giving in to any misconception or if everyone else is just blinded by the $$-signs. As I said before. The network and community itself seems so vivid that I really want to participate. But at the same time, most communication stops at a rather superficial level while everything for the team itself is the hard to understand with any IT-background.\\n\\nLooking forward to hear your thoughts on the topic.", "MAIN": "anchor protocol hey folk,\\n\\nfirst things first. i'm fairly new to the crypto scene as well as to reddit as a network to have a discussion on. so please excuse my clumsy choice of words, if i'm using wrong terms in the following.\\n\\ni recently stumbled over the anchor protocol of the terra network, which offers various ways to invest money. even so i'm very impressed with the project is idea, the names of the team and the amount of people already involved, i still have some doubts about how safe it is, to put my money there.\\n\\nso as one of various options to stake your money (i will only talk about this one for now), the anchor protocol claims to guarantee 20 apr on the amount of ust that is being deposited. this sound like a crazy good deal regarding the aprs you would currently receive at a bank (at least here in germany) which would be around 0.5 to 1.0 apr. so the question that springs to mind is, how is that even possible?

It?s a peer-to-peer system that enables anyone to send and receive payments anywhere. Instead of being physical money carried around and exchanged in the real world, cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries to an online database describing specific transactions. The transactions are recorded in a public ledger when you transfer cryptocurrency funds. Cryptocurrency is stored in digital wallets.\\n\\nCryptocurrency received its name because it uses encryption to verify transactions. This means advanced coding is involved in storing and transmitting cryptocurrency data between wallets and public ledgers. The aim of encryption is to provide security and safety.\\n\\nThe first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, founded in 2009,d is the best known today. Much of the interest in cryptocurrencies is to trade for profit, with speculators at times driving prices skyward.

 \\nCryptocurrency is a digital payment system that doesn't rely on banks to verify transactions. It?s a peer-to-peer system that enables anyone to send and receive payments anywhere. Instead of being physical money carried around and exchanged in the real world, cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries to an online database describing specific transactions. The transactions are recorded in a public ledger when you transfer cryptocurrency funds. Cryptocurrency is stored in digital wallets.\\n\\nCryptocurrency received its name because it uses encryption to verify transactions. This means advanced coding is involved in storing and transmitting cryptocurrency data between wallets and public ledgers. The aim of encryption is to provide security and safety.\\n\\nThe first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, founded in 2009,d is the best known today. Much of the interest in cryptocurrencies is to trade for profit, with speculators at times driving prices skyward.

We would like to hear your feedback on our project!\\n\\nCurrent solutions are either centralized,  while putting a lot of restrictions on the users (quite ironic when you preach decentralization!) and pose custodial risks and many defi projects are built for crypto natives with a multitude of steps that makes things too complicated for a mainstream user. \\n\\nRight now, on DeStreet, you can purchase coins that are on the polygon network. We have integrated  DEX aggregator 1inch ([https://1inch.io/aggregation-protocol/](https://1inch.io/aggregation-protocol/)) to get you the best prices.\\n\\n**Onboarding**\\n\\nWe don?t do any KYC since we are not a crypto exchange, only a platform.\\n\\nSo our onboarding is very quick, takes less than 2 minutes. Just enter your email, you will receive an OTP and you are good to go.\\n\\n**Key Management:**\\n\\nAs soon as you sign up, we generate a wallet for you.

We would like to hear your feedback on our project!\\n\\nCurrent solutions are either centralized,  while putting a lot of restrictions on the users (quite ironic when you preach decentralization!) and pose custodial risks and many defi projects are built for crypto natives with a multitude of steps that makes things too complicated for a mainstream user. \\n\\nRight now, on DeStreet, you can purchase coins that are on the polygon network. We have integrated  DEX aggregator 1inch ([https://1inch.io/aggregation-protocol/](https://1inch.io/aggregation-protocol/)) to get you the best prices.\\n\\n**Onboarding**\\n\\nWe don?t do any KYC since we are not a crypto exchange, only a platform.\\n\\nSo our onboarding is very quick, takes less than 2 minutes. Just enter your email, you will receive an OTP and you are good to go.\\n\\n**Key Management:**\\n\\nAs soon as you sign up, we generate a wallet for you.

{"title": "", "selftext": "\\n\\nCryptocurrency has a lot of benefits over traditional payment mechanisms. It is decentralized, and it has an algorithmically determined money supply that leads to a stable currency. Those are all very important benefits, but to the everyday user, they might seem a little bit abstract. The everyday user just wants a simple, fast, effective payment mechanism to use without hassle. In this article, I wanted to take a little bit of time and discuss one of the **more tangible benefits of cryptocurrency usage for normal, everyday users - the quick payment settling speed.**\\n\\n**Slow Speeds Create Disagreement**\\n\\nWith traditional payment methods, such as credit cards, it can take anywhere from 24 hours to three days for funds to move from one person's bank account to another person's bank account. Obviously, this can create confusion and disagreement if one person thinks they have paid for something but the other person has not yet received funds in their bank account.\\n\\nImagine for a moment that you pay for a airplane flight, hotel reservation, or bus ticket with your credit card on Tuesday night. When you show up on Wednesday for your hotel or flight, the business owner politely notifies you that you will need to pay them since they have not yet received anything from your account. Both parties believe that they are in the right. If you paid with your credit card on a Tuesday night, you could easily look at your bank account and see that you had pending charges. At the same time, the merchants would not yet have any payment received in their account. Even though both parties have the best of intentions, the length of time that it takes to settle this payment can cause disagreement and cause both parties to suspect each other of wrongdoing. The merchant would think that the customer is trying to avoid paying , and the customer would think that the merchant is trying to double charge them.\\n\\n**Crypto Provides Speed and Certainty**\\n\\nNow, instead of paying with credit cards, let's suppose that we were paying with the USDC stablecoin or the Dai stablecoin. These are both cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of $1 and are exchanged on the Ethereum network. According to eth gas station, it currently takes about 19 cents to make a transfer that will process and settle in about 2 minutes. Remember that the average credit card charge takes between 24 hours and 3 days to settle. Even if we give credit cards the benefit of the doubt and assume that every transfer happens at the fast end of that spectrum and completes in 24 hours, that still means that transferring USDC or Dai is over 720x faster.\\n\\nThis fast transfer speed is important because it gives both parties the confirmation that payment has been tendered and payment has also been received. Perhaps even more importantly, this record of transfer is publicly available in an immutable blockchain that can be reviewed and consulted in case there is ever a discrepancy on whether somebody actually paid or not.\\n\\nCryptocurrency offers a whole host of benefits over traditional payment methods, but even if we discount the importance of decentralization or censorship resistance, cryptocurrency can still offer many improvements over traditional payment methods. The long delay that it takes to process pending charges via traditional credit card can be a source of confusion and disagreement between merchants and customers. The ability to conduct near-instantaneous transfers and settle payments quickly is just one more actual use case that will make crypto the money of the future.\\n\\n**References**\\n\\n[CreditCardProcessing.com](https://www.creditcardprocessing.com/2013/12/long-take-merchant-receive-funds/)\\n\\n[Eth Gas Station](https://www.ethgasstation.info/)\\n\\nImage Credit\\n\\n[https://unsplash.com/@sortino](https://unsplash.com/@sortino)", "MAIN": "crypto is fast- here is why that matters \\n\\ncryptocurrency has a lot of benefits over traditional payment mechanisms. it is decentralized, and it has an algorithmically determined money supply that leads to a stable currency. those are all very important benefits, but to the everyday user, they might seem a little bit abstract. the everyday user just wants a simple, fast, effective payment mechanism to use without hassle. in this article, i wanted to take a little bit of time and discuss one of the **more tangible benefits of cryptocurrency usage for normal, everyday users - the quick payment settling speed.**\\n\\n**slow speeds create disagreement**\\n\\nwith traditional payment methods, such as credit cards, it can take anywhere from 24 hours to three days for funds to move from one person is bank account to another person is bank account. obviously, this can create confusion and disagreement if one person thinks they have paid for something but the other person has not yet received funds in their bank account.\\n\\nimagine for a moment that you pay for a airplane flight, hotel reservation, or bus ticket with your credit card on tuesday night. when you show up on wednesday for your hotel or flight, the business owner politely notifies you that you will need to pay them since they have not yet received anything from your account. both parties believe that they are in the right. if you paid with your credit card on a tuesday night, you could easily look at your bank account and see that you had pending charges. at the same time, the merchants would not yet have any payment received in their account. even though both parties have the best of intentions, the length of time that it takes to settle this payment can cause disagreement and cause both parties to suspect each other of wrongdoing. the merchant would think that the customer is trying to avoid paying , and the customer would think that the merchant is trying to double charge them.\\n\\n**crypto provides speed and certainty**\\n\\nnow, instead of paying with credit cards, let is suppose that we were paying with the usdc stablecoin or the dai stablecoin. these are both cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of $1 and are exchanged on the ethereum network. according to eth gas station, it currently takes about 19 cents to make a transfer that will process and settle in about 2 minutes. remember that the average credit card charge takes between 24 hours and 3 days to settle. even if we give credit cards the benefit of the doubt and assume that every transfer happens at the fast end of that spectrum and completes in 24 hours, that still means that transferring usdc or dai is over 720x faster.\\n\\nthis fast transfer speed is important because it gives both parties the confirmation that payment has been tendered and payment has also been received. perhaps even more importantly, this record of transfer is publicly available in an immutable blockchain that can be reviewed and consulted in case there is ever a discrepancy on whether somebody actually paid or not.\\n\\ncryptocurrency offers a whole host of benefits over traditional payment methods, but even if we discount the importance of decentralization or censorship resistance, cryptocurrency can still offer many improvements over traditional payment methods. the long delay that it takes to process pending charges via traditional credit card can be a source of confusion and disagreement between merchants and customers. the ability to conduct near-instantaneous transfers and settle payments quickly is just one more actual use case that will make crypto the money of the future.\\n\\n**references**\\n\\n[creditcardprocessing.com]( gas station]( credit\\n\\n[", "level_1": 2, "level_2": 0, "level_3": 3, "datatype": "Miscellaneous"}

{"title": "", "selftext": "Happy New Years everyone! Here are some resolutions and things to remember when going into 2022. \\n\\n1) Always invest in the King and Queen. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most solid projects in crypto are will anchor your portfolio. \\n2) Diversify but not too much. Do not put all your eggs in one basket but dont over spread. Too hard to manage and keep up to date with everything. \\n3) If it sounds too good to be true, it more than likely is. Yes you can make good profits from crypto but the odds of becoming a millionaire overnight is not realistic at all for 99% of crypto users. \\n4) Remember to take Profits (DCA out). Yes I know we all love to Hodl and I'm saying you shouldn't, I am saying make sure and capitalize on the stretches of gains. Take some out and stake with stable coins. When a dip happens, sell stable coins and then buy. \\n5) Careful with the Memecoins. Have some fun in life and gamble a little but remember, it is very much a gamble. \\n6) DYOR. Make sure and do your own research people and do not blindly follow people. Most people around here, myself included, have little to no idea what is actually going to happen. \\n7) Remember that time in market is better than timing the market. As mentioned before, becoming a millionaire doesn't happen overnight. \\n8) Only invest what you can afford to lose! Investments are never a sure thing. Be prepared to lose it all. If you can live with that, then you are in a comfortable place. \\n9) Set a goal and be happy when you reach it. Dont be greedy here people.

{"title": "", "selftext": "I?m curious what people think about EIP-1559. You can find a good explanation of the proposal [here.](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/ethereum-improvement-proposal-ETH-gas-fee)\\n\\nThis, along with ETH 2.0 and drastic reduction of block rewards is why I?m so bullish on ETH. \\n\\nEIP-1559 is very controversial however. Here?s a TL;DR on Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559\\n\\n- The current auction-based fee system that a lot of other popular coins use will potentially be done away with. \\n\\n- Users will pay a static fee with the option of a tip. The fee will be burned (removes ETH from circulation) and the tips will go to the miners. \\n\\n- The goal is to fill half the block with standard transactions and the other half with tipped transactions. \\n\\n- The base fee will increase and decrease. If all available transactions will fill 50% or the block the base fee rises. If they fill less than 50% of the block the fee falls. \\n\\n- The tip is a way to ensure you?re in the next block. This bit is the controversial part to me. It?s removing an auction system but keeping an auction system for 50% of a block. \\n\\n- Flexible block sizes are on the table. \\n\\n- This promises to DRASTICALLY reduce the fees for ETH transactions and start to deflate ETH by burning the base fees. This is good for upward price movement. \\n\\n\\nI am a miner (albeit not as big as I was when I had 36 1070s mining in 2017) and I?m all for this EIP. Bigger miners aren?t as big a fan. They see fees being burned and issuance being cut and they?re nervous. \\n\\nI feel like this will be moot when ETH 2.0 merges with ETH. ETH 2.0 is live right now and is dubbed The Beacon Chain. Soon (hopefully end of 2021) ETH as it stands today will be added to ETH 2.0\\nas a shard of the Beacon Chain.

I bought a few hundred $ of Doge and parallelly start to explore other altcoins. As I was reading more and more, mainly in r/cc sub, I realized Doge is shit, and there other great projects with real business/development value. I sold my Doge, and bought some XRP, ADA, VET, ONE. As I was continued to explore, I was buying more coins. Later on, bought some LTO as it looked really promising, and ETH also. I didn't buy any BTC, the return will be small I was thinking, and the best is to earn on alts and then transfer earnings into BTC.  I made some really quick gains and started to sell my coins as I was thinking to buy them again when they drop.

{"title": "", "selftext": "The \"PER transaction\" carbon, electricity and e-waste metric is such a deceitful metric. Anyone who uses it is willful ignoring that:  \\n\\n* there are several other chains that are merge mined with the same hashpower as bitcoin (Syscoin is one of the biggest).  So does syscoin have zero carbon responsibility because it uses BTC's hash in merge mining ?  The authors of such metrics would like us to believe so.   \\n\\n* There are hundreds of thousand of transactions that take place on the Lightening network.  Why are the authors of these \"per transaction\" metrics willfully ignoring all the activity on the Lightening network ?  Is it because they are to lazy to actually figure out how many transactions are taking place ? Or are they trying to push an agenda.   Besides lightening network, there are other layer 2 networks, like liquid.  Where thousands of transactions take place.  \\n\\n* The current hashpower secures ALL PAST transactions.  The current hashpower isnt just used to write the current transactions in a block, but its used to secure every single previous transaction in bitcoins history.   \\n\\n* The block reward is more than just a normal transaction.\\n\\n The block reward can be considered as a kind of battery whereby the electricity used to make hashes is transformed into a more easily kept and stored unit.  In a way,  these newly created bitcoin can be considered as a form of stored electricity.  The electricity used to create those bitcoins gets transformed into unit of accounts.  These units then can be transformed back into electricity via purchasing power that the BTC units have.  Or even more literally, they can be used to hire mechanical work from humans or other machines (using BTC to rent a generator that produces energy, or renting a solar array to charge a battery).  So figuratively the block reward acts as a sort of battery.  The energy isn't \"wasted\"  its merely transformed into units that can be more easily stored over time and sent across the planet.  \\n\\nThe bitcoin energy usage discussion is a very nuanced one, and it's very intellectually lazy to try to use comparisons of \"per transaction\".  Lets look at GPU gaming.  It uses more electricity than the bitcoin network, but it doesnt generate units of account that can be used forever (or as long the BTC network exists).  It just generates fun (at the time) and perhaps some fond memories.

But again, bitcoin energy is transformed into units of account that can be used for as long as the network exists.  \\n\\nUsing a per tx metric to talk about bitcoin energy use is disingenuous and intellectually lazy. Bitcoins energy use is a more nuanced conversation than just \"per transaction\"", "MAIN": "using a per transaction metric to talk about bitcoin energy use is disingenuous and intellectually lazy. here is why: the \"per transaction\" carbon, electricity and e-waste metric is such a deceitful metric. anyone who uses it is willful ignoring that: \\n\\n* there are several other chains that are merge mined with the same hashpower as bitcoin (syscoin is one of the biggest). so does syscoin have zero carbon responsibility because it uses btc is hash in merge mining ? the authors of such metrics would like us to believe so. \\n\\n* there are hundreds of thousand of transactions that take place on the lightening network. why are the authors of these \"per transaction\" metrics willfully ignoring all the activity on the lightening network ? is it because they are to lazy to actually figure out how many transactions are taking place ? or are they trying to push an agenda. besides lightening network, there are other layer 2 networks, like liquid. where thousands of transactions take place. \\n\\n* the current hashpower secures all past transactions. the current hashpower isnt just used to write the current transactions in a block, but its used to secure every single previous transaction in bitcoins history. \\n\\n* the block reward is more than just a normal transaction.\\n\\n the block reward can be considered as a kind of battery whereby the electricity used to make hashes is transformed into a more easily kept and stored unit. in a way, these newly created bitcoin can be considered as a form of stored electricity. the electricity used to create those bitcoins gets transformed into unit of accounts. these units then can be transformed back into electricity via purchasing power that the btc units have. or even more literally, they can be used to hire mechanical work from humans or other machines (using btc to rent a generator that produces energy, or renting a solar array to charge a battery). so figuratively the block reward acts as a sort of battery. the energy isn't \"wasted\" its merely transformed into units that can be more easily stored over time and sent across the planet. \\n\\nthe bitcoin energy usage discussion is a very nuanced one, and it is very intellectually lazy to try to use comparisons of \"per transaction\". lets look at gpu gaming. it uses more electricity than the bitcoin network, but it doesnt generate units of account that can be used forever (or as long the btc network exists). it just generates fun (at the time) and perhaps some fond memories. or take a look at x-mas trees lights ( they can be considered not very useful in that they only provide ascetically pleasing lights for a tiny period, yet consume the amount of energy as small countries. but again, bitcoin energy is transformed into units of account that can be used for as long as the network exists. \\n\\nusing a per tx metric to talk about bitcoin energy use is disingenuous and intellectually lazy. bitcoins energy use is a more nuanced conversation than just \"per transaction\"", "level_1": 2, "level_2": 1, "level_3": null, "datatype": "Negative"}

Feel free to share this wherever and whenever you like.\\n\\nHere's some sites you can use to check up on other users before deciding how much weight to give their professed opinion:\\n\\nhttps://reddit-user-analyser.netlify.app/ - The simplest and fastest user analysis tool that I use.

There are also graphs of their comments and submissions by date.\\n\\nYou can use this information to identify users who bolster their reputation in karma farming subs; potential shills who are likely to be biased in their 'advice'; trolls who are just trying to cause disruption etc etc.\\n\\n\\nhttps://redditmetis.com/ - Is another site that analyzes a user, similar to reddit-user-analyser but in addition to displaying where and when they post and get karma it also will actually use their posts to extract information they have stated about themselves such as their employment, nationality etc. This shouldn't be taken as completely reliable as not only can it make mistakes but it also has no way of knowing if a user has lied. Some information has a # link next to it which leads you to the comment from which the information was extracted, this lets you consider context and judge it's veracity for yourself.\\n\\nAnother great feature of redditmetis is the activity heatmap, showing when in the day a user posts. If they claim to be from Canada but they only post in working hours Moscow time then that may raise a red flag...\\n\\n\\nhttps://www.redditinvestigator.com/ - Similar to the first two however much slower to generate the analysis. I'd suggest giving it a try, although I use it much less than the others. The one unique feature is that it extracts the website links used in submissions to show you if the user frequently links to certain sites. In the context of crypto, if someone is constantly shilling their shitcoin you might expect to see a high frequency of links to the coin's ICO for example.\\n\\n\\n\\nhttps://camas.github.io/reddit-search/ - This site lets you search all comments a user has made on a certain sub, within a certain timeframe and/or including keywords. If you wanted to find all the posts made by account X in r/cryptocurrency that included their shillcoin Y you could do so. Similarly if someone is trying to drive down interest in a competing project you might search for terms like 'Overpriced' or 'Shitcoin' and see how often they sue those in association with their opponent.\\n\\nhttps://redditcommentsearch.com/ - Does similar to the above but with less search options. No fields to limit date range for example, but otherwise perfectly useful. Sometimes simplicity is good.\\n\\n\\n\\nhttps://www.reveddit.com/ and https://www.removeddit.com/ - Both of these sites allow you to view deleted comments from discussions, assuming that the comments wasn't removed too quickly. You'll often see users arguing in what appears to be bad faith, spreading disinformation about projects or lying to hype something up.
