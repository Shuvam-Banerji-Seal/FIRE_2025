"Our Podcast covered the Coss.io situation in a new format we decided to call Red Flags where we lay out red flags, and what excuses there could be for them. We'd love feedback!","After years of talking about red flags on the CryptoBasic Podcast, we decided to make it official and have a format where we strictly cover the red flags of a project. We break down each red flag, why it's bad, and what excuses there could be for it to not be a red flag, and then give our opinion of the aggregate of the red flags we've seen. We covered the Coss.io situation in this first episode with this new format, and we focused heavily on some of the mod drama that was put front and center in this subreddit (related to the other subreddit of course). We would love feedback on the format, and feel that we are helping contribute to thought out analysis rather than FUD or tribalism in the space.

YOU are at WAR. Make No Mistake About. Are YOU Ready?,"Let me ask you a question. If the American President got up and said heï¿½s taking the Country to war, and the generals had no plans of any kind other than to shoot stuff up, what would you think? \n\nThat would be insane right.? Well if youï¿½re new to Bitcoin (started this year), recognize that youï¿½re at war, without a plan. Youï¿½re up against some savvy and smart people who are intent to shake you down. They know all of your tendencies, they know the exact dollar amount it will take to shake 90% of you out of the market. \n\nThey know what you desire most - financial freedom, and they know that you  think BTC is your golden ticket. \n\nWhat do you know about them? \n\nWho are they? \n\nWho were the people buying little tiny chunks of BTC every single minute back in 2020 to accumulate massive positions?\n\nWho are the people Coinbase is POSSIBLY feeding data about their customers and their holdings to? \n\nRobinhood made $700M selling customer trade info to hedge funds, you donï¿½t think Coinbase may POSSIBLY be doing the same? \n\nHow is this information being weaponized against you? \n\nHow large are their staffs of data scientists and analysts? \n\nWhat sort of media connections do these people have? \n\nHow are those connections being leveraged to shape your thinking? \n\nFolks, make no mistake about it. \n\nYou are at war. \n\nThere are people with money, skills, connections, and access to information who wake up everyday with one goal; to shake you down. \n\nThey are preying on your emotions with cold blooded callousness. In 2018 they told you straight to your face; ï¿½We will tame Bitcoin.ï¿½ And they did. The bear market started that same week. \n\nIn 2021 They got you buying BTC at $50k and $60k directly from them after they had bought for $4k - $10k. \n\nThey led you to believe that institutions would experience FOMO at those levels and abandon their fiduciary duty to their clients to pile into BTC. \n\nThey know you wouldnï¿½t stop to think how ridiculous that sounds because youï¿½re trading on hope, and theyï¿½re trading on math, manipulations, connections, and a keen understanding of human emotion. \n\nThey know that many people will capitulate - buy high, sell low.  They know that people who were buying around $65k are down nearly 40%. \n\nThey know that many of these same people will say to themselves ï¿½Iï¿½ll hang on and cash out when I lose half my money, I donï¿½t want to sell now because itï¿½s a dip and I donï¿½t want to miss the bounce, but when Iï¿½m down half, I gotta get out....ï¿½ \n\nWhen theyï¿½ve successfully shaken you down for your coin, the cycle will repeat. \n\nIt will repeat for years until the majority of people who have never cashed out of Bitcoin PROFITABLY - avoid it like the plague. \n\nThey will have it all to themselves.  \n\nHereï¿½s My Plan\n\nI sold my BTC in Jan at $39,000 and swapped it for EOS and ETC and made a bunch more money. I closed ALL of my EOS and ETC positions and took a small portion to re-enter BTC around an important price level. That level broke.

"Shitcoin Sunday- Saitama, Lilly Finance, and DD vs FUD","Shitcoin Sunday- Saitama, Lilly Finance, and DD vs FUD\n\nThis my first post here and I hope that I am bringing something good to the table. I have enjoyed lurking here for years but am usually too busy to get involved on Reddit. Luckily, I have some extra time on my hands, a few extra bucks to spare, and wanted to bring some awareness of concerns with a token growing in popularity. \n\nI like to dabble in shitcoins, where else can you potentially 100x or 1000x your pocket change in a very short time. But this space of the cryptosphere is rife with bullshit and DD is paramount to make sure you don't get rugged. Keep in mind, DD is NOT FUD. It is research into the history of and team behind any investment you are considering. Not doing DD leads to FUD as unsubstantiated rumors swirl. Established facts are not FUD and they should be considered as part of DD.\n\nEnter Saitama token. Saitama token was minted as Saitam Inu on May 30, 2021. You can have a poke around the creator wallet here if you want to go down the rabbit hole that I have but this post is not about some of the red flags there.\n\nHere is the creator wallet:\n\n0x980817e617ca5cDf220e87f5544592BF7a9661b3\n\nBack in June when I first came across this token it felt like a money grab. The webpage at that time was full of stock photos of young people and claimed that their goal was education. The Saitama team claimed that they are going to teach young and Gen Z people ""how money works while they invest"" and ""financial literacy"". How were they going to do this? By selling them a shitcoin.\n\nFast forward a few months and they have dropped the Inu from their name, they have amassed over 200,000 holders with no major listings, and the token has skyrocketed. Millionaires were made. No educational products were. \n\nLast night the devs at Saitama LLC threw a launch party for their new wallet in Vegas and rented a billboard in time square. No wallet is released, not even a beta for public testing, and some drunken youtuber supported by the devs makes a disappointing launch party into a shit show by begging money for drinks for most of his livestream. Public sentiment drops, as does the token price. Just another day in the shitcoin universe. \n\nThe other announcement they were celebrating was a new partnership with a medical company. This company, Lilly Finance, claims that they are going to revolutionize medical payments. Go to the Dr and pay with crypto. Their inspiration for this is the CEOâ€™s sick daughter. The COO of Saitama LLC is announced as a co-founder of Lilly Finance and you will only be able to buy the Lilly token through Saitamask, the upcoming Saitama wallet. \n\nSo who is Lilly Finance? It is a subsidiary of a company called Lillian Bay Medical LLC. Lillian Bay was registered 2 years ago and works in medical wholesale. The CEO of Lillyan Bay has been accused of being a part of a multimillion dollar fraud related to n95 mask distribution and is a defendant in a Racketeer, Influenced, and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) case.\n\nHer is the Lilly Finance website:\n\n[https://lillyfinance.com](https://lillyfinance.com/)\n\nYou can see their corporate registration here:\n\n[https://opengovus.com/sam-entity/117736642](https://opengovus.com/sam-entity/117736642)\n\nYou can read about the fraud accusation here:\n\n[https://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/news/2020/12/30/ceo-of-lillian-bay-medical-accused-of-defrauding.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/news/2020/12/30/ceo-of-lillian-bay-medical-accused-of-defrauding.html)\n\nYou can follow the court filings related the the RICO case here:\n\n[https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/37687996/TriPharma,\_Inc\_v\_Safe\_Harvest\_Medical,\_LLC](https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/37687996/TriPharma,_Inc_v_Safe_Harvest_Medical,_LLC)\n\nSo what is Saitamaâ€™s relationship to Lilly Finance and why are they forging an exclusive partnership with them for their wallet launch? I looked up the contract address on the Lilly Finance website and had a poke around. This was difficult to do as the address is an image and not text so I had to manually type it.\n\nHere is the contact address if you want to have a look yourself:\n\n0xD0222AF85B9B08D38233F4bc940646bf18445949\n\nThere I found the address of the wallet that created and currently holds all of the Lilly supply. You can find it here:\n\n0x3Af0eD4573E7e1c11CDffE9Af970bff7DCFAffd3\n\nOf note is that the first and last transactions from the wallet that created Lillly are a round trip of ETH in and out from a top Saitama whale who has been in Saitama since day one. Remember, the COO of Saitama LLC is on the board of Lilly Finance and is listed as a co-founder. Here is that wallet address:\n\n0xF9A98037b5cCd0185161D762278FC009C8056c4e\n\nMore worrisome is that said wallet has been dumping huge amounts of Saitama the last several weeks. That person has become very wealthy and their dumps are likely affecting the price of Saitama.\n\nSo, we have a professional connection between Lilly and Saitama by way of a common board member and we have financial evidence of connection between an early Saitama investor and the creation of Lillyâ€™s token.\n\nWhat does all this mean? That is up to the individual investor to decide. DD is about gathering all of the facts and assessing them against your risk tolerance. Given the sentiment on the Saitama boards greed is strong and these facts donâ€™t seem to matter to many investors.\n\nMy broader concerns are with the ethics of both companies.

Where to find 100x potential.,"Not financial advice.\n\nAs BTC recovers to its ATH I see a lot of new people coming in again, asking what is the next token/coin to explode.\n\nMost of the suggestions are protocols that are already on centralised exchanges, these are not going to be your 100x tokens, because they've already had the exposure needed to get listed on centralised exchanges.

Figure out how to use Metamask so you can connect to Dexes and allow yourself to buy these tokens (after doing some DD, always buy good projects) before they're listed on centralised exchanges i.e binance, Coinbase, FTX etc. \n\nYou'll also be surprised to see the far better 'interest rates' staking on the Dexs compared to Cexs. \n\nMoral of the story, if someone is telling you to buy something on here then it's probably too late. DYDR and you'll have a much better chance of finding that 100x token.","where to find 100x potential. not financial advice.\n\nas btc recovers to its ath i see a lot of new people coming in again, asking what is the next token/coin to explode.\n\nmost of the suggestions are protocols that are already on centralised exchanges, these are not going to be your 100x tokens, because they've already had the exposure needed to get listed on centralised exchanges. of course there is every chance they can still do 2-5x, and that is good enough also but anyone is guess is as good as nipples on a bull. \n\nwhat you need to do is to look at which layer 1 protocols are pumping and buy into the protocols in their ecosystem. figure out how to use metamask so you can connect to dexes and allow yourself to buy these tokens (after doing some dd, always buy good projects) before they're listed on centralised exchanges i.e binance, coinbase, ftx etc. \n\nyou'll also be surprised to see the far better 'interest rates' staking on the dexs compared to cexs. \n\nmoral of the story, if someone is telling you to buy something on here then it is probably too late. dydr and you'll have a much better chance of finding that 100x token.",0,,,

The Wallet Craze,"I started out with some LTC, DOT, ETH and Lumens and let them sit on Binance and Coinbase. I didn't realize you could go to ""pro"" versions and save on some fees. I then read the infamous ""not your keys, not your coins"", so I quickly looked into some wallets.  Hot, cold, desktop, browser...oh my. I decided to go with Coinbase Wallet and Trust (logical, right?!) and transferred everything there. (some more fees) In the meantime I buy some ATOM and ADA cause FOMO.\n\nThen I read, oh the most secure is cold so get a Trezor or Ledger. I buy Ledger and put everything on there. (Some more fees)\n\nBut oh wait! You can earn interest on Exodus, Kraken and here and there's different rates. Ok, so transfer ADA and ATOM to Exodus (fees) DOT to Kraken cause I never meet the minimum (fee). LTC, ETH and Lumens sit on Ledger. \n\nAww man here comes Algo Governance and ATOM airdrops and DOT para chain auctions and, oh yeah lets get some VET and throw that on another wallet to get VETHOR. Oh and fuck Lumens, exchange for Algo (super small fee).\n\nNow I have a nice collection of 5 different types of wallets, with dust sitting in a few other ones and fees handsomely collected by all. I'm happy now with my current situation and staking % and am also a bit wiser, but man oh man, sit down and read, read, read all about the coins you buy and where they do what. I know there's probably more for me to learn, but maybe this post will help out some noobs consolidate early and correctly. Can't wait for the tax man. \n\nTLDR: I used a bunch of different wallets and paid too many fees. Take the time to understand the benefits of your crypto and where to get them.","the wallet craze i started out with some ltc, dot, eth and lumens and let them sit on binance and coinbase. i didn't realize you could go to ""pro"" versions and save on some fees. i then read the infamous ""not your keys, not your coins"", so i quickly looked into some wallets. hot, cold, desktop, browser...oh my. i decided to go with coinbase wallet and trust (logical, right?!) and transferred everything there.

[WEEK 4] Crypto Fantasy League! Game Week 4 results and League Table!,"Welcome to the fourth week of the **CRYPTO FANTASY LEAGUE** called **MOONLEAGUE.** \n\nOnce again, you can read the rules here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m0ceaa/if\_crypto\_was\_a\_sport\_league\_and\_coins\_a\_team/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m0ceaa/if_crypto_was_a_sport_league_and_coins_a_team/)\n\nThe results from **GAME WEEK 3** are here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mft6nn/week\_3\_crypto\_fantasy\_league\_game\_week\_3\_results/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mft6nn/week_3_crypto_fantasy_league_game_week_3_results/)\n\nAltcoin season is here! Many teams could enjoy this week as almost all teams gained some valuable points. Growth points are here, and this season is getting spicy. There was some serious movement, and a couple of interesting results. \n\nBefore I present the results, here is also one important update, in the next week I will work on a subreddit called: Moonleague. Everybody who wants to follow the results or share some info during game week you are free to do so. Once the subreddit is ready I will inform you with a post. \n\nHere are the GAME WEEK 4 results: \n\n**Crypto.com vs. Cosmos**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s9ez93elm5r61.png?width=483&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4277a8497e883f484d372b8fca973cf636fdc725\n\nThis was a tight game. Crypto.com gained some valuable points this week with Visa piloting the capability with Crypto.com. Cosmos was also pretty active, as they launched IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication), and that are good news for the team. They have managed to get some nice growth points but it was a close battle, and Crypto.com took the victory this week \n\n**Tether vs. Uniswap**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/80wp9afom5r61.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56a621cc22fe099dcad72b956869a4bdb3b24d43\n\nMystery didnâ€™t help Tether this week. With news that they are backed by undisclosed reserves, well that brought them just a slight growth rate, still enough to grab at least a point. Some may arguing that Uniswap is to centralized, but nonetheless, Uniswap managed to get a good amount of points this week with a pretty looking growth rate. \n\n**XRP vs. Bitcoin Cash**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ubz1hncqm5r61.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57517d0ba96cf64fd66bb582a5c7747fd2948555\n\nXRP and SEC, what a love story that is this year. XRP is now worth more today than before the SEC lawsuit, interesting! This week they are back on track, even though they lost this match, they will be happy to grab some valuable points. \n\n**Ethereum vs. NEM**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/apbr45zrm5r61.png?width=483&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12bdf781bdcb06dae4d032da1133ceac47bb863e\n\nThis week was a good one. Ethereum fans are happy and they finally played a great game and managed to achieve massive gains this week. Ethereum is looking to extend this form also next week and keep on hoping that April is the start of the Altcoin season that everybody was waiting for. NEM didnâ€™t had any chance this week, but at least they managed to get some growth points out of this, they still need a miracle in the next weeks to stand a chance for a decent spot in the league. \n\n**Binance Coin vs. USD Coin** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xt690mwtm5r61.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0120510bddb533ff55fc1046afb4f3412330dda1\n\nBinance did a fantastic job this week, and they pulled out a wonderful growth rate, making them a serious contender for a play-off spot. USD Coin is just grabbing some tiny but important points, and with VISA onboard they are looking to perform even better in the next weeks. \n\n**Aave vs. Litecoin**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/esv6sflvm5r61.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7b27bd1c39e92510e77dc7ed5eebaa178abb19b\n\nAave announced that they are working with Polygon to bypass Enthereum congestion, and that reflected positively, they finally had a good week and the entire team is now keen to keep pushing further. Litecoin is now available over PayPal, this was not enough for a victory, but they will be happy to take some points and hoping for a good next game week. \n\n**Cardano vs. Dogecoin**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1k94c7zxm5r61.png?width=483&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd3ebc9e0324be39224570c826fe8506d16abf25\n\nCardano was one of two teams that had a negative rate this week, and the large ADA community is certainly not happy about it. Dogecoin and Elon are in love again, with plans to get them on the moon. In the moonleague, Dogecoin still needs to push a bit harder if they want to get that Moon, still it was a good week and the managed to get some points and a win out of this. \n\n**Bitcoin vs. Stellar** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mdsjiggzm5r61.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33c1ad6783f1ae10bc01670e52d5f4f2d82da59d\n\nBitcoin was still able to get some points this week, after a long time they are not in the spotlight, they still managed to get some points here and they will be happy about it. Stellar finally did a good job. After a disappointed start, they grabbed a important win here with a healthy and good looking growth rate. \n\n**THETA vs. VeChain**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t515fe11n5r61.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=363644fbc4eaad8a2bf4bfb1867040690115c210\n\nTHETA is the dark horse of this competition, and this week the bull run is put on a hold, they lost the game and they lost some points, they will be happy not to lose much here and it wonâ€™t affect them in terms of their position in the Moonleague. VeChain won, and they it was barely a positive outcome. They will be sad, as they didnâ€™t make the best out of this week, especially with THETA generating some minuses. \n\n**Chainlink vs. Polkadot**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kuzc9523n5r61.png?width=483&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3087c856c38f9a80c8e3093b9d68ff171ee636bc\n\nChainlink released native substrate module to bring its oracles to Polkadot, and that helped them achieve a nice growth rate, but Polkadot took the upper hand with this week news, making them almost unstoppable this week. We can now say with confidence that Polkadot is back in the game! Great performance from both teams, unfortunate that they played against each other this week, considering the news that both teams announced this week. \n\n**LEAGUE TABLE after GAME WEEK 4**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fd1486iim5r61.png?width=1072&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a816a17dc156a360cc4eb82d7b39802170c51e1\n\nThere was a lot of movement in the league table this week. We got some new entries into the playoff spot. THETA is still leading the way with a huge gap between them and the second placed VeChain. Mid-table is really interesting with 5 teams having the same amount of points. Other teams are still able to pull of a surprise, Polkadot showed what a good game week can do, as they jumped straight into a playoff sport this week. NEM is still looking bad, and the team needs to start performing if they want to make something out of this season. \n\n**BIGGEST GAINER: POLKADOT â€“** 11 position up  \n\n**BIGGEST DROP: TETHER â€“** 6 positions down \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PERFOMER OF THE WEEK:** \n\n**POLKADOT:** They had the biggest growth rate this week: 36,41%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**UNDERPERFOMER OF THE WEEK:** \n\n**THETA:** They had a negative rate of: -6,75% \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**GAME WEEK 5 FIXTURES:** \n\nGAME 1: THETA (1) vs. Crypto.com (5)\n\nGAME 2: VeChain (2) vs. Bitcoin (6)\n\nGAME 3: Binance Coin (3) vs. Cardano (8)\n\nGAME 4: Tether (13) vs. XRP (9)\n\nGAME 5: Litecoin (10) vs  Chainlink (11)\n\nGAME 6: Cosmos (15) vs USD Coin (16)\n\nGAME 7: Ethereum (7) vs. Uniswap (17)\n\nGAME 8: Bitcoin Cash (14) vs. Polkadot (5)\n\nGAME 9: Stellar (18) vs. Aave (19)\n\nGAME 10: NEM (20) vs. Dogecoin (12)","[WEEK 4] Crypto Fantasy League!

Some may arguing that Uniswap is to centralized, but nonetheless, Uniswap managed to get a good amount of points this week with a pretty looking growth rate. \n\n**XRP vs. Bitcoin Cash**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ubz1hncqm5r61.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57517d0ba96cf64fd66bb582a5c7747fd2948555\n\nXRP and SEC, what a love story that is this year. XRP is now worth more today than before the SEC lawsuit, interesting! This week they are back on track, even though they lost this match, they will be happy to grab some valuable points. \n\n**Ethereum vs. NEM**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/apbr45zrm5r61.png?width=483&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12bdf781bdcb06dae4d032da1133ceac47bb863e\n\nThis week was a good one. Ethereum fans are happy and they finally played a great game and managed to achieve massive gains this week. Ethereum is looking to extend this form also next week and keep on hoping that April is the start of the Altcoin season that everybody was waiting for. NEM didnâ€™t had any chance this week, but at least they managed to get some growth points out of this, they still need a miracle in the next weeks to stand a chance for a decent spot in the league. \n\n**Binance Coin vs. USD Coin** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xt690mwtm5r61.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0120510bddb533ff55fc1046afb4f3412330dda1\n\nBinance did a fantastic job this week, and they pulled out a wonderful growth rate, making them a serious contender for a play-off spot. USD Coin is just grabbing some tiny but important points, and with VISA onboard they are looking to perform even better in the next weeks. \n\n**Aave vs. Litecoin**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/esv6sflvm5r61.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7b27bd1c39e92510e77dc7ed5eebaa178abb19b\n\nAave announced that they are working with Polygon to bypass Enthereum congestion, and that reflected positively, they finally had a good week and the entire team is now keen to keep pushing further. Litecoin is now available over PayPal, this was not enough for a victory, but they will be happy to take some points and hoping for a good next game week. \n\n**Cardano vs. Dogecoin**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1k94c7zxm5r61.png?width=483&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd3ebc9e0324be39224570c826fe8506d16abf25\n\nCardano was one of two teams that had a negative rate this week, and the large ADA community is certainly not happy about it. Dogecoin and Elon are in love again, with plans to get them on the moon. In the moonleague, Dogecoin still needs to push a bit harder if they want to get that Moon, still it was a good week and the managed to get some points and a win out of this. \n\n**Bitcoin vs. Stellar** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mdsjiggzm5r61.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33c1ad6783f1ae10bc01670e52d5f4f2d82da59d\n\nBitcoin was still able to get some points this week, after a long time they are not in the spotlight, they still managed to get some points here and they will be happy about it. Stellar finally did a good job. After a disappointed start, they grabbed a important win here with a healthy and good looking growth rate. \n\n**THETA vs. VeChain**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t515fe11n5r61.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=363644fbc4eaad8a2bf4bfb1867040690115c210\n\nTHETA is the dark horse of this competition, and this week the bull run is put on a hold, they lost the game and they lost some points, they will be happy not to lose much here and it wonâ€™t affect them in terms of their position in the Moonleague. VeChain won, and they it was barely a positive outcome. They will be sad, as they didnâ€™t make the best out of this week, especially with THETA generating some minuses. \n\n**Chainlink vs. Polkadot**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kuzc9523n5r61.png?width=483&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3087c856c38f9a80c8e3093b9d68ff171ee636bc\n\nChainlink released native substrate module to bring its oracles to Polkadot, and that helped them achieve a nice growth rate, but Polkadot took the upper hand with this week news, making them almost unstoppable this week. We can now say with confidence that Polkadot is back in the game! Great performance from both teams, unfortunate that they played against each other this week, considering the news that both teams announced this week. \n\n**LEAGUE TABLE after GAME WEEK 4**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fd1486iim5r61.png?width=1072&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a816a17dc156a360cc4eb82d7b39802170c51e1\n\nThere was a lot of movement in the league table this week. We got some new entries into the playoff spot. THETA is still leading the way with a huge gap between them and the second placed VeChain. Mid-table is really interesting with 5 teams having the same amount of points. Other teams are still able to pull of a surprise, Polkadot showed what a good game week can do, as they jumped straight into a playoff sport this week. NEM is still looking bad, and the team needs to start performing if they want to make something out of this season. \n\n**BIGGEST GAINER: POLKADOT â€“** 11 position up  \n\n**BIGGEST DROP: TETHER â€“** 6 positions down \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PERFOMER OF THE WEEK:** \n\n**POLKADOT:** They had the biggest growth rate this week: 36,41%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**UNDERPERFOMER OF THE WEEK:** \n\n**THETA:** They had a negative rate of: -6,75% \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**GAME WEEK 5 FIXTURES:** \n\nGAME 1: THETA (1) vs. Crypto.com (5)\n\nGAME 2: VeChain (2) vs. Bitcoin (6)\n\nGAME 3: Binance Coin (3) vs. Cardano (8)\n\nGAME 4: Tether (13) vs. XRP (9)\n\nGAME 5: Litecoin (10) vs  Chainlink (11)\n\nGAME 6: Cosmos (15) vs USD Coin (16)\n\nGAME 7: Ethereum (7) vs. Uniswap (17)\n\nGAME 8: Bitcoin Cash (14) vs. Polkadot (5)\n\nGAME 9: Stellar (18) vs. Aave (19)\n\nGAME 10: NEM (20) vs. Dogecoin (12)",0,,,

Crystal Ball Time,"Predictions for the last week are due to end tomorrow. My optimism of calling 10% up is currently looking good (please don't prompt a market crash!) \n\nCurious to hear long term predictions from people for Christmas. \n\nWhat are your expected top 10 (ignoring stable coins) and why? \n\nMine are:\n1. Bitcoin - still the best known.\n2. Ethereum - I expect the gap to close but still not high enough on brand awareness.\n3. Cardano - could make good progress with the upcoming updates.\n4. XRP - I think SEC will finally finish and it'll head back up.\n5. Binance Coin - I'm torn. I think BSC helps this with the high gas fees on ETH but binance seem to be getting cracked down on a lot. They could suffer. \n6. Polkadot - expecting it to continue to push up. \n7. Solana - making some really impressive gains. \n8. Link - also doing really well. \n9. Polygon - I think this could explode up again. \n10. VeChain - if the market continues to pick up and they continue with their projects we could see the hype really return. \n\nHard to pick just 10, anything can happen, but share your thoughts!","crystal ball time predictions for the last week are due to end tomorrow. my optimism of calling 10% up is currently looking good (please don't prompt a market crash!) \n\ncurious to hear long term predictions from people for christmas. \n\nwhat are your expected top 10 (ignoring stable coins) and why? \n\nmine are:\n1. bitcoin - still the best known.\n2. ethereum - i expect the gap to close but still not high enough on brand awareness.\n3. cardano - could make good progress with the upcoming updates.\n4. xrp - i think sec will finally finish and it'll head back up.\n5. binance coin - i'm torn. i think bsc helps this with the high gas fees on eth but binance seem to be getting cracked down on a lot. they could suffer. \n6. polkadot - expecting it to continue to push up. \n7. solana - making some really impressive gains. \n8. link - also doing really well. \n9. polygon - i think this could explode up again. \n10. vechain - if the market continues to pick up and they continue with their projects we could see the hype really return. \n\nhard to pick just 10, anything can happen, but share your thoughts!",0,,,

"Shot in the Dark, but why not in this crazy life","Hear writes to you  a Ex British Army Veteran, father freethinker who knows the route this world is heading towards regarding crypto currencies from working in the fintech industry until COVID \n\nI Lost my job and my father in the last year, one to COVID and one to Cancer.\n\nI find myself back home in the sleepy South east of Scotland.

Yesterday It Was Quantum Computers and Today Itï¿½s Too Difficult and Too Much Energy,"Sure seems like someone or some groups out there besides a certain car person will try anything to hammer bitcoin.  Last year all the FUD was around the threat of quantum computers being able to break the encryption of bitcoin and therefore donï¿½t participate in it because thatï¿½s dangerous.  Now the problem is bitcoin is actually too secure, unnecessarily secure, because it uses a lot of energy to maintain that difficulty, and so you shouldnï¿½t participate in it because anything that uses ï¿½too muchï¿½ energy is just bad.   Honestly feels like since no one can  control bitcoin, unlike every other asset in existence, that means for whatever reason even antithetical sets of reasons, we should all just stay in our sandbox and quit looking beyond.","Yesterday It Was Quantum Computers and Today Itï¿½s Too Difficult and Too Much Energy Sure seems like someone or some groups out there besides a certain car person will try anything to hammer bitcoin.

Help with UniSwap,"Hi all,\n\nBit of a Crypto-noob here, trying to figure out what exactly I have done and if it's reversible.\n\nI previously yolo'd around 70 euro's worth of BTC profits into Shiba coin. Just to see what the hype is surrounding meme coins. Fast forward to like a month later and suddenly it's up 500% (doge pump and dumpers moved to Shiba coin). Not wanting to waste the opportunity I tried to swap my Shiba coin to Ethereum through uniswap.\n\nWent through all the steps and then when it promoted a better price (V3) and wrote allow the uniswap to use your SHIB, I accepted. Normally I'd take the time to research what it meant and figure out the correct steps. But in this case the spike in the worth of the coin and it's volatility, made my eyes glaze over and lit a fire under my ass, making me throw caution to the wind (a good learning moment, keep calm when prices spike). Now this is where I get confused. In my trust wallet it shows that I still have the Shiba coin, my Ethereum decreased due to the gas fee. It seems like the swap hasn't worked. Yet when I head back to uniswap there's now a injected contract which I can view on etherscan (I see there the amount of Shib I initially wanted to transfer) and when I head to my Ethereum wallet there's a smart contract call which also brings me to etherscan. \n\nSo I have the following questions:\n\nDo I need to retrieve my funds from etherscan?\nDo I have to wait?\nDo I need to go through the process again and not accept uniswap to use my Shib?\nDo dance and pray to the crypto God's to successfully get my Shib coin swapped into ETH?\n\nAny advice and help is welcome.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nR3DLAB","help with uniswap hi all,\n\nbit of a crypto-noob here, trying to figure out what exactly i have done and if it is reversible.\n\ni previously yolo'd around 70 euro is worth of btc profits into shiba coin. just to see what the hype is surrounding meme coins. fast forward to like a month later and suddenly it is up 500% (doge pump and dumpers moved to shiba coin). not wanting to waste the opportunity i tried to swap my shiba coin to ethereum through uniswap.\n\nwent through all the steps and then when it promoted a better price (v3) and wrote allow the uniswap to use your shib, i accepted. normally i'd take the time to research what it meant and figure out the correct steps. but in this case the spike in the worth of the coin and it is volatility, made my eyes glaze over and lit a fire under my ass, making me throw caution to the wind (a good learning moment, keep calm when prices spike). now this is where i get confused. in my trust wallet it shows that i still have the shiba coin, my ethereum decreased due to the gas fee. it seems like the swap hasn't worked. yet when i head back to uniswap there is now a injected contract which i can view on etherscan (i see there the amount of shib i initially wanted to transfer) and when i head to my ethereum wallet there is a smart contract call which also brings me to etherscan. \n\nso i have the following questions:\n\ndo i need to retrieve my funds from etherscan?\ndo i have to wait?\ndo i need to go through the process again and not accept uniswap to use my shib?\ndo dance and pray to the crypto god is to successfully get my shib coin swapped into eth?\n\nany advice and help is welcome.\n\nthanks in advance,\n\nr3dlab",0,,,

Some questions about bots," \n\nI posted this in a different sub, related to the specific token (AVAX) but thought this was general enough to post here as well.  I researched some projects for a couple of months before actually putting money in the market. At first I was using straight market purchases from Coinbase, Crypto.com and Uphold. Once I was comfortable with that and moving things from various wallets, I started on Coinbase Pro and Bitrue. Once I figured that out, I realize it is way better and has helped me be able to better position my assets.\n\nI've heard of bots and think I get the general idea, but had never run into one so obvious until a couple of days ago. At least I'm pretty sure this is what I'm looking at.\n\nThis has been the entire close order section for AVAX for a couple of days now, though two days ago it was running around 119-120.5. I watched for a bit and it would work market price down then work it back up, but always staying right near that range.\n\n1. Is this a bot?\n2. If this is a bot, what is the goal?\n3.

Why I Buy Crypto Daily,"Hey everyone, I've been slowly buying DOGE everyday. Why doge you ask? Well its cheap, a single coin is 5 cents and it surprisingly has kept that 5 cent line for a few months. I don't see it going to a dollar anytime soon but the its nice and easy to buy.\n\nThe main reason though is because my viewers make me buy it. I'm a small time streamer and one of the things you can redeem for channel points is me buying a single doge coin. Some days I buy 10, some days 1 it all depends. \n\nThis is a fun experience because it promotes crypto, even though it's not the best crypto it still gets the word out and people interested. Either that or they just want to see me go broke.\n\nI plan on adding more crypto themed things on my channel since I'm a huge believer in it. \n\nIf you guys want to see me drop money on DOGE make sure to stop by id appreciate it and we can also have a chat.\n\nThanks","why i buy crypto daily hey everyone, i've been slowly buying doge everyday. why doge you ask? well its cheap, a single coin is 5 cents and it surprisingly has kept that 5 cent line for a few months. i don't see it going to a dollar anytime soon but the its nice and easy to buy.\n\nthe main reason though is because my viewers make me buy it. i'm a small time streamer and one of the things you can redeem for channel points is me buying a single doge coin. some days i buy 10, some days 1 it all depends. \n\nthis is a fun experience because it promotes crypto, even though it is not the best crypto it still gets the word out and people interested. either that or they just want to see me go broke.\n\ni plan on adding more crypto themed things on my channel since i'm a huge believer in it. \n\nif you guys want to see me drop money on doge make sure to stop by id appreciate it and we can also have a chat.\n\nthanks",0,,,

A quick guide to crypto fundamental analysis,"The concept of fundamental analysis entails finding the intrinsic value of a particular crypto by looking at various factors associated with it. It involves digging through its history, understanding its purpose, and what makes it valuable, among others. \n\nNot only does this research help determine if the crypto is worth investing in, but you can also use it to check if it is a suitable long-term investment option for you.\n\nThe number of cryptos keeps increasing every day. So, it is vital to understand that they are projects usually undertaken by a single person or a group of people. All cryptos do not have the backing of a reputed company or the stability that you might need. \n\nTo investigate this and find if crypto is undervalued or overvalued at the moment, investors rely on fundamental analysis. In fact, you will notice several veteran crypto investors use fundamental analysis to understand crypto. \n\nThe fundamental analysis of crypto consists of some basic research. For starters, you can analyse the team behind the crypto offering. Usually, every crypto developer has a GitHub profile, where they post updates regarding the project. You can also check the purpose of the project, and if it answers any existing problems in the market.\n\nYou can also use factors like the number of wallets created, the number of transactions made, and the volume and frequency of these transactions to gauge an estimation of the crypto?s value. While performing fundamental analysis, you should remember that crypto analysis is vastly different from analysing any other finances. For starters, it requires a lot of research since it is a relatively new space in the market. \n\nSecondly, there are a lot of variables involved. To get a better grasp of the fundamental analysis of crypto, hop on to [this detailed blog](https://blog.coindcx.com/cryptocurrency/how-to-do-fundamental-analysis-in-crypto/) by CoinDCX.","A quick guide to crypto fundamental analysisThe concept of fundamental analysis entails finding the intrinsic value of a particular crypto by looking at various factors associated with it.

Dutch Financial Markets Authority survey: half crypto investors see it as a gamble,"The majority of the 1.2 million Dutch crypto investors seem to be aware of the risks involved in investing in crypto currencies. Almost half have only put in a maximum of 500 euros. There is also a group that gets into serious trouble if the price drops. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis concerns a group of about 100,000 consumers, calculates regulator Authority for the Financial Markets [based on a survey by Ipsos](https://www.afm.nl/~/profmedia/files/nieuws/2021/attitudes-van-cryptobezitters.pdf?la=nl-nl). If 90 percent of the value of their crypto were to evaporate in a month, they would have a financial problem that they would not be able to absorb, or only with great difficulty. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA 90 percent drop in value, by the way, is extreme, says the AFM. The authority regularly warns of the dangers of investing in crypto currencies because they do not fall under their supervision. This increases the risk of unsuspecting investors putting their money in a pyramid scheme disguised as a crypto currency. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother major risk for investors is the violent price fluctuations. The largest crypto, bitcoin, went from a price of about $30,000 (26,600 euros) this year to well over double that, collapsed again to below 30,000, climbed to a record high of $69,000 and has now fallen again by about 30 percent to $50,000 value. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Less return, also less stress**\n\nBy the way, the stock price is still 73 percent higher than on January 1 of this year. By comparison, the AEX is about 28 percent higher, but the price of the main Dutch stock market index went up and down a lot less. The moment at which someone decided to invest, therefore, mattered less and the chance of losing (part of) your deposit is also smaller if you suddenly need the money. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInvestors also do take into account a crash in the price of crypto currencies. Of all the risks surrounding cryptos, this one tops the list, followed by losing the investment due to theft, scams or the bankruptcy of an exchange or crypto exchange. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen assessing risk, it is notable that those who also invest in things other than just cryptos are a lot more pessimistic than those who have put all their cards on cryptos.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Small amounts**\n\nThe latter group, on the other hand, is a bit more cautious about how much money they put in. More than half of the group that only invests in cryptos, only invests with an amount of up to 500 euros. This may also have to do with the fact that relatively many young people invest in cryptos, and they have even less to spend. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAmong those who invest not only in cryptos but also in stocks, for example, the group that invests only such a relatively small amount is a lot smaller. Almost a third invest for a maximum of 500 euros, 35 percent are in it for an amount of at least 2,500 euros.","Dutch Financial Markets Authority survey: half crypto investors see it as a gamble The majority of the 1.2 million Dutch crypto investors seem to be aware of the risks involved in investing in crypto currencies.

Crypto Market Update (week 37)," C**rypto and equities markets finished the last week with losses, preparing for this week?s FED announcements.** Crypto markets dropped heavily with Bitcoin down by over 10% compared to the previous week, closing at 19.419 on Sunday. ETH experienced the biggest slump by almost 25%.\n\nThe Merge had successfully taken place on September 15th, 2022, at 08:42:42 GMT+2 at a Block #15.537.393, marking the full transition of the network from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), which will cut energy consumption by about 99.95% compared to the PoW consensus mechanism. However, the successful upgrade had not fuelled the Ether?s price further up. Instead, the price remained flat at the Merge event and finished the week down at 1.335. Equities, on the other hand, dropped by around 5% with NASDAQ closing at 11.448 and S&amp;P closing at 3.873 last Friday.\n\n**The FED is expected to raise interest rates by another 0.75% this week.** The consumer price index, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on last Tuesday, increased by 0.1% in August, ending at 8.3%, down from 8.5% in July 2022, but still at four-decade highs. Headline inflation rose 0.1% month over month, even with falling petrol prices.\n\nCore inflation rose 0.6% month over month, translating to an annual increase of 6.3%, up from 5.9% recorded during the previous period. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been expecting a decline of 0.1% for overall inflation, with a rise of 0.3% for core inflation. Moreover, Economists polled by Reuters forecast the CPI fell by 0.1% month-on-month in August, resulting in 8.1% for August 2022, down from 8.5% a month earlier.\n\nDespite the drop in gasoline prices, the rise in core inflation fuelled speculation that the FED will have to step up with further rate increases on its next meetings. According to Refinitiv, **the new expectations point the federal funds rate to a new target range of 3.80% to 4.20% by end of 2022, with a peak of 3.94% ? 4.45% around March 2023.**\n\nOverall, the crypto market sentiment (measured by Crypto Fear &amp; Greed Index) continues to stand at **21/100, indicating Extreme Fear**, compared to a month ago when the Index stood at 29/100. The total crypto market cap had dropped by almost 10%, crossing below the $1 trillion mark. ETH dominance slightly dropped to 18% (from 20.5%) and Bitcoin went slightly up to 39.4%. As we had pointed out in our previous week?s macro analysis, the ETH Merge was a typical buy-the-rumour-sell-the-news event. The Protocol?s technical upgrade had already been priced in.\n\n**WATCH OUT FOR:** The next monetary policy meetings are scheduled for September 20-21st, 2022 for the FED and October 27th, 2022, for the ECB. The next US CPI release for September 2022 is scheduled for October 13th, 2022. The next US GDP update will be released on September 29th, 2022, followed by October 27th. 2022.","Crypto Market Update (week 37) C**rypto and equities markets finished the last week with losses, preparing for this week?s FED announcements.** Crypto markets dropped heavily with Bitcoin down by over 10% compared to the previous week, closing at 19.419 on Sunday.

Recent Crypto news that you might have missed.," After experiencing the bear phase, the crypto market is hoping to emerge well in the winter season. Considering that Bitcoin is still going strong despite the dip, it is no surprise that El Salvador invested in nearly 80 additional bitcoins at $19000 each. \n\nWhile crypto investors are actively looking for an excellent opportunity to invest in bitcoin, the President, Nayib Bukele, gave breaking news through Twitter about the purchase. The country currently holds 2381 bitcoins, proving authenticity for audiences still sceptical about the coin. \n\nThe President also highlighted the fact that Bitcoin is the future of crypto and has potential in the long run. This also denotes that a bear market has its own set of opportunities one can use. \n\nBitcoin is decentralised money launched in 2009 and raises many eyebrows. Initially, it didn?t have a lot of trust from the people, but the current status of the coin is proof that it did evolve for good. \n\nAt the moment, there are several third-party apps like CoinDCX that offer impressive programs like Earn for beginners to be able to earn passively through crypto. This program is based on a simple banking system, except the money is replaced by crypto coins. \n\nApart from exchanging coins and keeping a close eye on the market, investors are also practising the idea of lending and staking. These concepts are far more accessible than mining and affiliate programs, especially for beginners still getting hold of the crypto world. \n\nIn the latest news, Binance has also collaborated with Khaby Lame, who happens to be an internet sensation for his humorous reaction to the life hack videos.

How I Turned a 495 Matic($325) Investment into 2873 Matic($2500) in a just 25 Days.,"\n\nIn my companion circle, we examine a few distinct undertakings and thoughts for procuring automated revenue. An end that we as a whole came to settle on was that it is generally critical to know when a task is sending off and get in right on time. At times, a venture can be at 0.0004 per token or even less.\n\nThe task talked about in this article. This isn?t focused on crypto novices, this is for people currently acquainted with involving wallets in DeFi, best wellbeing rehearses, gas charges, and crossing over of tokens.\n\nSo here is how I turned a 495 Matic ($325)investment on VaporNodes into 2873($2500) in 30 Days.\n\nI Monitored Social Media\n\nThe only way to find out about new and upcoming projects is to keep up to date through Twitter, Medium, Telegram, and Discord. Watch for new projects and investigate them.\n\nI Observed The Network\n\nIt?s basic to be familiar with the association the endeavor runs of by virtue of gas costs to ensure rewards. By virtue of VaporNodes it runs on Avalanche Network. Expecting that a comparable errand were on the Ethereum association, *Polygon Network* I could never have potentially contributed because of the gas charges.\n\nI Bought the Project Token in Earlier phase into Launch\n\nOnce I assessed the risk of the project, I invested in the token and hold as much to get good results. One more important thing is I always took Principle (Investment) on the pump and get my investment Principle. This all happened in the span of a few weeks. I wanted my initial investment back. I only kept *495 Matic* worth of *PNT Token* at that time and put that into a Trust wallet Dapp.\n\nThe price of PNT has moved up to 0.002240 matic. It's still early until it reaches 1 PNT = 1 Matic\n\nIntroduction Of PNT Token\n\nThe Polyatomic Network is a decentralized application based on the Polygon blockchain that has been capturing value by offering the most attractive spreads, an auto-adjusting spec and consumption component, and frictionless, separate compensation for a long time in the MATIC coin.\n\nThis is probably the best work on Polygon Blockchain that can generate unregulated revenue through the fantastic protocol in dApps.\n\nTheir local area strengths coupled with fun opportunities, and a ton of imaginative changes to the digital currency universe will cause it to grow into an enterprise worth watching.\n\nThe PNT TOKEN:\n\nPNT (Polytomic Network Token) is the power and close by token for Polytomic Network. The PNT savvy understanding is a self-making pay framework for holders.\n\nIt is a neighborhood project that spreads and remunerates MATIC between neighborhoods subject to clear conditions.\n\nIt was built on the Polygon blockchain, and PNT tokens can be purchased with MATIC in the Polyatomic dApp on TrustWallet/Metamask.\n\nThe installment to buy PNT is in MATIC and not in dollars, so eventually you will have the opportunity to profit from any cost increase. Holders can sell their PNT at the point when they need it which makes it perfectly suited for them.\n\nNothing is found on record so holders get two benefits in MATIC coin as well as price energy for PNT which becomes more MATIC.\n\nRewards\n\nThe MATIC reflection token has shown the ultimate fate of biological systems. HODLers of PNT will receive secret rewards by basically holding the tokens in their wallets, as each exchange such as purchases, sales and profit withdrawals individually has spending fees of 10%, 10% and 10% which are all existing symbolically. is expressed equally. In the wallet of the holders is indicated by their PNT volume.\n\nFor each exchange, a piece is saved to boost the liquidity pool and prize pool for all holders. Thereafter, PNT intends to pursue a 'Hold and Procure' culture, thereby reducing the selling pressure.\n\nThis is accomplished through smart contract capacities, which mechanize the symbolic rearrangement, and those holders should simply deal with the wallet in which their tokens are put away.\n\nRewards are naturally accessible to circulate once every new client purchases the PNT in their dApp. Probably the best element is that you have control of your own prizes payouts by pulling out at whatever point you need in the Polytomic dApp.\n\nBenefits Of Income\n\nThe benefits of income are very important here. The Polyatomic Network (PNT) is the first to provide huge income from its system whenever someone buys a PNT token. 65% goes to the PNT community and 35% is distributed to all PNT holders according to their PNT holdings. So here you have maximum PNT and you will get big profit.\n\n\nThe second biggest benefit is passive income. Here one can make $1,000,000 matic or more by passive or by recommending other people. The above passive is described as your direct reference (1st level) you get 10%, 2nd level 4%, 3rd level 2%, 4th level 1%, 5th to 10th level 0.5%, 11th to 14th level 0.25% And get 15th level. The level is 1%. One can make huge profits by recommending through this robust system.\n\n\n Step by Step Instructions to Start\n\n1. Download Trustwallet or MetaMask and send all MATIC into it through your trade by means of the Polygon organization.\n\n2. Go to dApps section in trustwallet and paste this link?[Polytomic ](https://polytomic.network/registration/?referral=0xd4320bE6BFC32dDF53480140a12ceEC4C20B1549)\n\n3. Ensure that you are associated with the polygon Network which you can see on the upper right of the picture.\n\n4. Subsequent to associating with the wallet, store all the MATIC that you have and enlist it.\n\n5. There you go, now you?re a holder of Polytomic Network Token. Get ready to receive a daily dividend!\n\nThis is another undertaking with many things on the way. This is a great opportunity to buy a ton of MATICs and for those who have opened doors like this before. Assuming you have any inquiries and guides, then go ahead and message me on Telegram and WhatsApp.\n\nPNT is the project that successfully gave away thousands of metrics while holding the PNT token. As the price of PNT's Matic and Community increases, the PNT's price also increases, resulting in more Polygon (Matic) earnings.\n\nIf you found this article helpful, follow, clap and share with your friends!\n\nI would also be grateful (no pressure) if you decide to use my referral link here!\n\nDisclaimer : This is not financial advice, the information in this article is for educational purposes only.

A Oasis protocol (ROSE) shill post.,"Felt like a proper shill post is warranted these days as most posts right now are just low effort articles or posts about DCA. \n\n\n**Fundamentals:**\n\n-What is ROSE/Oasis Protocol? It's an L1 which can serve as an L2 and can allow ANY L1 to process secure, private off chain computation or give privacy qualities to literally any other crypto. The main implications of these are:\n\nPeople can control and monetize their data, companies can monetize data of their customers further without violating privacy laws, DeFi can offer new products such as under collateralized lending.\n\nParcel allows users and/or companies to store data on chain and sell or just make that data available without any of the personal information attached to said data. As example you can think of having medical records on chain. These records could help medical research and this can then be done without giving out your personal data (name and such). A partnership with Genetica has been formed to make this happen. \n\nA good article is here: https://docs.oasis.dev/oasis-network-primer/\n\n**tl;dr**: Rose unlocks an entirely new set of use cases &amp; products for crypto and allows corporations to play roles they otherwise would not be able to.\n\n-Dawn Song, the founder and CEO of Oasis Labs &amp; the Oasis Protocol, is the world's most reputable computer security scientist. A lot of her work is used as foundational components for some of the biggest crypto projects today. She is also a co-founder of a reputable cyber security company called Menlo Security which has thousands of REAL (not crypto vaporcompanies) customers including many F500's, and its last valuation was $800MM and it's very likely valued at over $1B today.\n\n**Product Roadmap:**\n\nOasis Labs' largest current product is called Parcel which is the core product for the ""letting companies monetize data in new ways"" concept. It is currently in use by several F500 companies and also a handful of other REAL non-crypto companies. However, Parcel is NOT yet on mainnet\n\nOnce Parcel is on mainnet, Oasis will officially have the most real world (non-crypto) usage outside of anything other than maybe ETH. In short: It's not just some DeFi shitcoin PnD chain like pretty much everything else is. It's coming to the table right away with more useful adoption than ANYTHING else has.\n\nThey're also soon to release both a Cipher and ETH paratime and bridges which will immediately alllow anyone to port over dapps, tokens, etc. to the network and make it usable for the majority of the crypto space, meaning all the DeFi use cases and even new use cases will be available for existing crypto entities.\n\n**Pumpamentals:**\n\n-ROSE had one of the highest VC raises of all time in crypto ($45MM in 2018) and has operated totally under the radar, finally launching the network in late 2020. -The VCs are legit crypto VC funds like a16z, Fred Eshram, Polychain, Binance, and others. Salesforce is listed on the Oasis Labs website but I can't find them listed on the Salesforce Ventures site so it's hard to know for sure about this one.\n \n-Recent history shows us with similar projects from a VC perspective, they ultimately pump like fucking crazy. Solana is a great example, and a lot of the same capital is invested in ROSE. These are players used to seeing minimally 50-100x on their investments and right now the earliest ones only have about a 5x. There is no fucking chance given the fundamentals they are going to sell ROSE for anything less than a 100x, mark my words ($3) and I am willing to bet many will hold large portions of their holdings way beyond that. -The public is starting to take notice. Whether it's discord shilling or whatever, I see more shitty crypto influencers starting to mention it, and it's only a matter of time before everyone does a full feature on ROSE and crypto twitter is talking about it. You are still early to the show that we're just watching start to unfold now. \n\n- Noteworthy to mention as well is Oasis's partnership with Meta something that should be highlighted by both Oasis and Meta very soon as said in the most recent Townhall meeting (1st of June). Seems to me at least that Meta will use Parcel to give users a way to monetize their data, but most importantly it gives Meta a more legal way to collect and sell/use data without violating privacy laws. \n\n**Fud:**\n\n-Token supply: 10B. Yea, it's a lot. We can easily just say ""crypto is a clown market, look at ADA ($3 at 45B max supply putting ROSE at a $13.50 price tag) or XRP or DOGE or whatever but I want to look beyond the clown market. The token release schedule is over TEN years. As I stated in pumpamentals it's very unlikely in the November unlock (which is one of the bigger ones) VCs just dump their bags. That would really surprise me. In 10 years, can a chain that enables entirely new important privacy oriented use cases have a market cap of a mere $10B? In TEN FUCKING YEARS? That's $1 ROSE. But realistically by then I think the mcap will be in the hundreds of billions of dollars, partly due to inflation but largely due to crypto adoption being in near full force by then. I see no reason ROSE can't hit $5-10 within the next couple of years and I actually think it could be a $20+ coin one day. -""It's just another L1/ETH killer"". No, it's an L1 but it is a VERY critical L2 and the L1 properties which are important right now have no competitors. It's an ETH enabler. In fact, much like LINK, it will enable everything in crypto to be more valuable than it already is.\n\n-Here's fud that I think is somewhat REAL but never actually gets discussed: There are no concrete plans for token holders to monetize their tokens after the staking gains wash up. Validators are not required to pay out on transaction fee profits, and none of them currently do. The theory is, the network will grow to a point where there will be plenty of alternative ways to monetize your ROSE via dapps (whether that's in DeFi or via a type of company/product that doesn't even exist yet), and empowering the ecosystem in other ways, that by the time staking gains dry up you'll still have reasons to hold. I'd look at this as a tl;dr of ""network succeeds - you win, network loses - token is worthless to you"", but if the network doesn't succeed the token will be worthless anyway. Additionally, I could see a world where validators are trying to accumulate bigger stacks to process more jobs and get a larger % of the network fees and so DO start paying a share of transaction fees to anyone staking with them. I think that's how it will play out. But ultimately, you also will always have the option to run your own validator and the crypto space is making this easier and easier for people.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nI didn't write most of this myself just changed a few things to make it up-to-date. This write up was made by an anonymous user on 4chan. I also am heavily invested in ROSE myself so take that into consideration as well. \n\nWould also not advice investing in ROSE at this time due to the current market situation, would just suggest on keeping an eye on ROSE for when the market turns more bullish again.","A Oasis protocol (ROSE) shill post.

It is coming to the table right away with more useful adoption than ANYTHING else has.\n\nThey're also soon to release both a Cipher and ETH paratime and bridges which will immediately alllow anyone to port over dapps, tokens, etc. to the network and make it usable for the majority of the crypto space, meaning all the DeFi use cases and even new use cases will be available for existing crypto entities.\n\n**Pumpamentals:**\n\n-ROSE had one of the highest VC raises of all time in crypto ($45MM in 2018) and has operated totally under the radar, finally launching the network in late 2020. -The VCs are legit crypto VC funds like a16z, Fred Eshram, Polychain, Binance, and others. Salesforce is listed on the Oasis Labs website but I can't find them listed on the Salesforce Ventures site so it is hard to know for sure about this one.\n \n-Recent history shows us with similar projects from a VC perspective, they ultimately pump like fucking crazy. Solana is a great example, and a lot of the same capital is invested in ROSE. These are players used to seeing minimally 50-100x on their investments and right now the earliest ones only have about a 5x. There is no fucking chance given the fundamentals they are going to sell ROSE for anything less than a 100x, mark my words ($3) and I am willing to bet many will hold large portions of their holdings way beyond that. -The public is starting to take notice. Whether it is discord shilling or whatever, I see more shitty crypto influencers starting to mention it, and it is only a matter of time before everyone does a full feature on ROSE and crypto twitter is talking about it. You are still early to the show that we're just watching start to unfold now. \n\n- Noteworthy to mention as well is Oasis is partnership with Meta something that should be highlighted by both Oasis and Meta very soon as said in the most recent Townhall meeting (1st of June). Seems to me at least that Meta will use Parcel to give users a way to monetize their data, but most importantly it gives Meta a more legal way to collect and sell/use data without violating privacy laws. \n\n**Fud:**\n\n-Token supply: 10B. Yea, it is a lot. We can easily just say ""crypto is a clown market, look at ADA ($3 at 45B max supply putting ROSE at a $13.50 price tag) or XRP or DOGE or whatever but I want to look beyond the clown market. The token release schedule is over TEN years. As I stated in pumpamentals it is very unlikely in the November unlock (which is one of the bigger ones) VCs just dump their bags. That would really surprise me. In 10 years, can a chain that enables entirely new important privacy oriented use cases have a market cap of a mere $10B? In TEN FUCKING YEARS? That is $1 ROSE. But realistically by then I think the mcap will be in the hundreds of billions of dollars, partly due to inflation but largely due to crypto adoption being in near full force by then. I see no reason ROSE can't hit $5-10 within the next couple of years and I actually think it could be a $20+ coin one day. -""It is just another L1/ETH killer"". No, it is an L1 but it is a VERY critical L2 and the L1 properties which are important right now have no competitors. It is an ETH enabler. In fact, much like LINK, it will enable everything in crypto to be more valuable than it already is.\n\n-Here is fud that I think is somewhat REAL but never actually gets discussed: There are no concrete plans for token holders to monetize their tokens after the staking gains wash up. Validators are not required to pay out on transaction fee profits, and none of them currently do. The theory is, the network will grow to a point where there will be plenty of alternative ways to monetize your ROSE via dapps (whether that is in DeFi or via a type of company/product that doesn't even exist yet), and empowering the ecosystem in other ways, that by the time staking gains dry up you'll still have reasons to hold. I'd look at this as a tl;dr of ""network succeeds - you win, network loses - token is worthless to you"", but if the network doesn't succeed the token will be worthless anyway. Additionally, I could see a world where validators are trying to accumulate bigger stacks to process more jobs and get a larger % of the network fees and so DO start paying a share of transaction fees to anyone staking with them. I think that is how it will play out. But ultimately, you also will always have the option to run your own validator and the crypto space is making this easier and easier for people.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nI didn't write most of this myself just changed a few things to make it up-to-date. This write up was made by an anonymous user on 4chan. I also am heavily invested in ROSE myself so take that into consideration as well. \n\nWould also not advice investing in ROSE at this time due to the current market situation, would just suggest on keeping an eye on ROSE for when the market turns more bullish again.",1,,,

There are rumors of Honduras, but Malaysia is emerging as a willing country to legalize cryptocurrency.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Consider making crypto a legal tender**\n\nDatuk Zahidi Zainul Abidin, Malaysia's Deputy Minister in the Ministry of Communications and Multimedia, [told parliament](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2022/03/21/comms-ministry-proposes-adopting-cryptocurrency-as-legal-tender) Monday that the country should consider adopting cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin as legal tender.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Youth love NFT**\n\nThe reason? The deputy minister is looking to the future and the youth. By making cryptocurrency a legal tender, he wants to support the young generation.

Introducing Payments and Transactions - How cryptocurrency blockchains work in the simplest terms.,"Bitcoin is a digital currency, with â€œcoinâ€ in its name, and the original White Paper describes it as electronic â€œcashâ€ and mentions â€œwallets.â€ So people may assume when payments are made, coins move from address to address, from wallet to wallet. This is not at all how Bitcoin works, the coins and wallets analogy is just that, an analogy.\n\n###How cryptocurrency blockchains actually work\n\nSuppose Alice wants to send One Bitcoin (BTC) to Bob\n\n- First she composes a new â€˜transaction messageâ€™ which reference the funds in her â€˜walletâ€™. These funds are composed of a combination of some of her previous transactions. These are known as the â€˜inputsâ€™. The sum of the inputs must total exactly or almost invariably more than the amount (due to fees), the amount she wants to send to Bob. \n\n- She must also note the address or public key to which she wants to send funds. These are called â€˜outputsâ€™. She signs the â€˜transaction messageâ€™ with her private keys corresponding to the input addresses and broadcasts it on the peer-to-peer network. \n\n- Itâ€™s unlikely that Alice will have a single prior transaction that she can use to pay Bob (i.e. 1.01 BTC, exactly one bitcoin plus the appropriate mining fee). More likely she will have many different possible â€˜unspent outputsâ€™ to choose from 0.87 - 0.34 - 1.15 - 3.5 - 0.02 - 0.001 - To make a payment she must combine these funds in such a way that she makes the correct payment to Bob. \n\n- So, she could use one big input (like the one for 3.5 bitcoins) and get change of 2.49 bitcoins back by including a second output for that amount to an address that she controls. The transaction would now have one input and two outputs.\n\n- Alternatively she could use two small inputs (like the ones for 0.87 and 0.34) but still want change (i.e. 0.2) for which she would provide a change address. That transaction would therefore have two inputs and two outputs.\n\n- If all goes well, a â€˜minerâ€™ will include the transaction in the next block after verifying that the inputs and signatures are valid. The transaction is now complete and Bob can now reference this completed transaction as an input into a future transaction when he wants to move his funds.\n\nThe key thing to realize is that there are no individual, atomic units of bitcoin that are transferred among addresses. What individuals â€œownâ€ are not bitcoins, but unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) that can serve as inputs for new transactions.\n\n###Why is this important to understand? Not your â€˜keysâ€™ not your â€˜walletâ€™!\n\nBecause it is not possible to track individual units of bitcoin, many legal questions of criminal activity and regulation (notably taxable events) are raised. Governments, law enforcement or criminals, can not track individual coins and instead concentrate on â€˜walletâ€™ addresses. When interacting with cryptocurrency blockchains - the addresses are the â€˜keysâ€™, literally and metaphorically, to ownership, security and privacy.\n\n###TL;DR There is no such thing as a â€˜Bitcoinâ€™. You do not store â€˜coinsâ€™ in a â€˜walletâ€™ - you keep a reference to records of your unspent transactions as a public key on the blockchain, which only your private key allow you to access (the crypto in cryptocurrency). Any payments and receipts, are updated as inputs and outputs, whose values, addresses and signatures are validated and verified by miners with the minting of new blocks, and secured onto the blockchain.\n\n(Any suggestions with wording or accuracy appreciated).\n\n[.](https://steemitimages.com/DQmbzafySPxgvggvABzDy9Lh2QR78kvCrwSApPiJKfDh5i4/what-is-blockchain-the-technology-explained.jpg)\n\nSome key information is sourced from an original article by Jerry Brito, Coin Center","introducing payments and transactions - how cryptocurrency blockchains work in the simplest terms. bitcoin is a digital currency, with â€œcoinâ€ in its name, and the original white paper describes it as electronic â€œcashâ€ and mentions â€œwallets.â€ so people may assume when payments are made, coins move from address to address, from wallet to wallet. this is not at all how bitcoin works, the coins and wallets analogy is just that, an analogy.\n\n###how cryptocurrency blockchains actually work\n\nsuppose alice wants to send one bitcoin (btc) to bob\n\n- first she composes a new â€˜transaction messageâ€™ which reference the funds in her â€˜walletâ€™. these funds are composed of a combination of some of her previous transactions. these are known as the â€˜inputsâ€™. the sum of the inputs must total exactly or almost invariably more than the amount (due to fees), the amount she wants to send to bob. \n\n- she must also note the address or public key to which she wants to send funds. these are called â€˜outputsâ€™. she signs the â€˜transaction messageâ€™ with her private keys corresponding to the input addresses and broadcasts it on the peer-to-peer network. \n\n- itâ€™s unlikely that alice will have a single prior transaction that she can use to pay bob (i.e. 1.01 btc, exactly one bitcoin plus the appropriate mining fee). more likely she will have many different possible â€˜unspent outputsâ€™ to choose from 0.87 - 0.34 - 1.15 - 3.5 - 0.02 - 0.001 - to make a payment she must combine these funds in such a way that she makes the correct payment to bob. \n\n- so, she could use one big input (like the one for 3.5 bitcoins) and get change of 2.49 bitcoins back by including a second output for that amount to an address that she controls. the transaction would now have one input and two outputs.\n\n- alternatively she could use two small inputs (like the ones for 0.87 and 0.34) but still want change (i.e. 0.2) for which she would provide a change address. that transaction would therefore have two inputs and two outputs.\n\n- if all goes well, a â€˜minerâ€™ will include the transaction in the next block after verifying that the inputs and signatures are valid. the transaction is now complete and bob can now reference this completed transaction as an input into a future transaction when he wants to move his funds.\n\nthe key thing to realize is that there are no individual, atomic units of bitcoin that are transferred among addresses. what individuals â€œownâ€ are not bitcoins, but unspent transaction outputs (utxos) that can serve as inputs for new transactions.\n\n###why is this important to understand? not your â€˜keysâ€™ not your â€˜walletâ€™!\n\nbecause it is not possible to track individual units of bitcoin, many legal questions of criminal activity and regulation (notably taxable events) are raised. governments, law enforcement or criminals, can not track individual coins and instead concentrate on â€˜walletâ€™ addresses. when interacting with cryptocurrency blockchains - the addresses are the â€˜keysâ€™, literally and metaphorically, to ownership, security and privacy.\n\n###tl;dr there is no such thing as a â€˜bitcoinâ€™. you do not store â€˜coinsâ€™ in a â€˜walletâ€™ - you keep a reference to records of your unspent transactions as a public key on the blockchain, which only your private key allow you to access (the crypto in cryptocurrency). any payments and receipts, are updated as inputs and outputs, whose values, addresses and signatures are validated and verified by miners with the minting of new blocks, and secured onto the blockchain.\n\n(any suggestions with wording or accuracy appreciated).\n\n[.]( key information is sourced from an original article by jerry brito, coin center",2,0,0,

Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency are a technology on a civilisatory scale for mankind,"ust answered to someone who made a thread about if he is too late for Bitcoin. I wanted to put it into perspective and had some thoughtgasms while I wrote this down. While I thought about what to say to that OP to convince him that we are early I realized that we are even earlier and that Crypto is absolutely inevitable.\n\nThis is no hopium, no telling you that ""the world is not  like it was before, mh mmhhh, nonono"", it is about PROVING to you that there is no way around crypto on a civilisarory scale. And all that in bad english from my mobile phone with broken touch screen!\n\nWhat I wrote to OP:\n\n\nThe Cryptospace certainly won't go away, of that I am sure. We're only slowly even figuring out the usecases. In Technology often the invention predates the usecases. When the Internet arrived, nobody knew that it would become a worldwide superarket, a means to order food, a means to judge said food, a means to post pictures of that food to random people or your friends, make a video for your yoututubechannel that pays for your Bills and made you a millionaire (this will be important later) and pay that food via the Internet. (This will be important now):\n\nThe Money you use for the payment has stayed offline though. The Internet however WILL incorporate EVERYTHING, that's in it's nature, some as we had pictures in the internet before the use of digital cams got widespread. But don't get me started on the topic of where technological advance and advance of production/consumption of energy logically and inevitably leads.\n\nMoney/Currency/A means to exchange worth MUST be completely digital and Bitcoin does exactly that. And with Smart Contracts and DEFI and NFTs we are now building the Usecases.\n\nWe are not only early, we are even earlier! Bitcoin won't make you rich overnight but if you stay In the cryptospace you can't do wrong. Also Bitcoin WILL increase in price, as will other coins and tokens. Right here in /r/cryptocurrency you basically get paid for your participation. 20 years ago nobody would have believed that you can become a millionaire by posting videos, maybe NOW you can become a millionaire by posting comments as well. \n\nIt's about Information. Everything is Information. YouTube videos are and comments are as well. Information has a monetary worth but only now are we able to send Worth through Information.\n\nQuestion: Moonbase. Or for this example even better: Marsbase.\n\nHow do we send ""worth""? Everything we move info space costs MUCH money. Sure we can transfer money from our bank account to the Moon-Colonists bank account. But no worth is actually being transferred. Unless it's crypto. If we send BTC to moon the private key is up there. It's the only and BEST way to exchange worth for multiplanetary species. The stockmarket CLOSES, Crypto can be traded 24/7. What time would the moon-stockmarket be open? You can't close it. I guarantee you that even before we have a Moonbase the stockmarket will somehow run on blockchains. Look out for projects that look out to do so\n\nAgain: The invention preceded the Usecase.\n\nCan you see how extremely early we are? We are together writing the very first words of an entirely new chapter of civilization.

we are not going to see significant drops,"Ok, I have to provide some background for this otherwise unsubstantiated claim.\n\nA few months ago I decided to change my diet from noodles to gruel. It is cheaper, check that out. Facts!\n\nWith this knowledge and discipline, I have been able to save $20.\n\nI knew that if I bought anything it would drop like a brick. I was therefore holding to my money.\n\nHowever, we are seeing ever deeper dips this week, and apparently the worst is yet to come.\n\nI knew I had to do something. I never had deeper pockets. I should be able to do something with them!\n\nShorting was the first idea. But I knew my position would be closed with a spike, and deeper dips would follow.\n\nSo I have set two limit orders for $10 each, BTC and ETH, at $14K and $1K respectively. Now you know prices will never be that low, perhaps 1Â¢ more, but not that low. Otherwise, those orders would be executed. That is not how my reality works.\n\nSorry I cannot save other cryptos yet, but constantly compounding on the gruel will allow me to do it over time. It is a matter of patience.\n\nSimilarly, if you are doing DCA, you may consider using similar limit orders with a fraction of your DCA budget (corresponding to one day at a time). A possible approach is like this:\n\n1. If it is your DCA day, and you have no limit order set up: Use the DCA amount to set an order at a price any percentage lower than today's price.\n1. If it is your DCA day, and you have a limit order set up, DCA as normal. You may choose to cancel the limit order and go to step 1.\n\nI will let you do the maths of the results and consequences but it is easy to see that this will trigger a permabull with constant ATHs. This is a result of the laws of the universe, just like the toast always falls on the jam side.\n\nHTH.","we are not going to see significant drops ok, i have to provide some background for this otherwise unsubstantiated claim.\n\na few months ago i decided to change my diet from noodles to gruel. it is cheaper, check that out. facts!\n\nwith this knowledge and discipline, i have been able to save $20.\n\ni knew that if i bought anything it would drop like a brick. i was therefore holding to my money.\n\nhowever, we are seeing ever deeper dips this week, and apparently the worst is yet to come.\n\ni knew i had to do something. i never had deeper pockets. i should be able to do something with them!\n\nshorting was the first idea. but i knew my position would be closed with a spike, and deeper dips would follow.\n\nso i have set two limit orders for $10 each, btc and eth, at $14k and $1k respectively. now you know prices will never be that low, perhaps 1Â¢ more, but not that low. otherwise, those orders would be executed. that is not how my reality works.\n\nsorry i cannot save other cryptos yet, but constantly compounding on the gruel will allow me to do it over time. it is a matter of patience.\n\nsimilarly, if you are doing dca, you may consider using similar limit orders with a fraction of your dca budget (corresponding to one day at a time). a possible approach is like this:\n\n1. if it is your dca day, and you have no limit order set up: use the dca amount to set an order at a price any percentage lower than today is price.\n1. if it is your dca day, and you have a limit order set up, dca as normal. you may choose to cancel the limit order and go to step 1.\n\ni will let you do the maths of the results and consequences but it is easy to see that this will trigger a permabull with constant aths. this is a result of the laws of the universe, just like the toast always falls on the jam side.\n\nhth.",2,0,0,

The environmental case for Bitcoin,"The environmental arguments against BTC have gained alot of traction in recent months - the basic construction is that Bitcoin uses ALOT of electricity for a low transaction throughput.  I will start by saying that I have alot of issue with self proclaimed environmentalists in both their assessment of and solutions to the problem of human impact on the worlds climate / environment, but I do think it is clear that human activity is having a detrimental effect on the planet and that there are things that can (and ought to) be done to improve that situation.  Additionally, I will say that any changes that can reduce the environmental impact of Bitcoin (or other proof of work assets) are worthwhile... I expect that these improvements are more likely to be related to ""cleaner"" electricity generation processes than changes to the BTC protocol itself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, to the real question at hand - why would I believe that BTC even in it's current state is a net positive for the environment?  The answer here simply boils down to the nature of deflationary units of account vs. inflationary ones.  World governments are currently in a dick measuring competition with each other over GDP... measured in how much useless shit gets cranked out and consumed on an annual basis.  If people start drinking water and stop drinking Coca-Cola... well they just lost an inch.  Through continual debasement of fiat currency, you can ensure that no one bothers to save for the future... and consumes as much now as possible.  Even in this sub it is often mentioned that nobody would buy a coke with BTC because the BTC might be worth more tomorrow... and that's EXACTLY the point.  Today... why wouldn't I buy a coke now when I know I can only buy half a coke in 4 years... this encourages the consumerist orgy to continue, don't save anything for the future, use it now before it's worth less.  With BTC when I look at that Coke i can say... do I want 1 coke now, or 2 in 4 years (the rate of future value increase does decline as adoption increases, but due to the deflationary nature of Bitcoin I am always incentivized to delay consumption as long as possible).  To be clear... my Coke consumption wouldn't drop to 0... but it does go way down.. I am still going to buy everything I need now (housing, food, etc.), and a few luxuries here and there... but overall, I am incentivized to consume less and entertain myself in other ways.  This is GOOD for the environment, and for human impact on the planet.  Why are we all rushing to buy that new Iphone with an improvement in picture quality you'd need an electron microscope to observe? because why not... it's not like delaying the purchase till my old phone breaks earns me anything.  With BTC - this gets flipped on its head.  I don't have a pile of cash losing value by the second that I am trying to dump in to anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR:  BTC uses alot of electricity and all other things being equal, that's likely not great for the environment, but BTC also breaks the debt cycle manipulation and encourages people to use what they need now and save the rest for later instead of consuming everything as fast as possible which is great for the environment.","the environmental case for bitcoin the environmental arguments against btc have gained alot of traction in recent months - the basic construction is that bitcoin uses alot of electricity for a low transaction throughput. i will start by saying that i have alot of issue with self proclaimed environmentalists in both their assessment of and solutions to the problem of human impact on the worlds climate / environment, but i do think it is clear that human activity is having a detrimental effect on the planet and that there are things that can (and ought to) be done to improve that situation. additionally, i will say that any changes that can reduce the environmental impact of bitcoin (or other proof of work assets) are worthwhile... i expect that these improvements are more likely to be related to ""cleaner"" electricity generation processes than changes to the btc protocol itself.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nnow, to the real question at hand - why would i believe that btc even in it is current state is a net positive for the environment? the answer here simply boils down to the nature of deflationary units of account vs. inflationary ones. world governments are currently in a dick measuring competition with each other over gdp... measured in how much useless shit gets cranked out and consumed on an annual basis. if people start drinking water and stop drinking coca-cola... well they just lost an inch. through continual debasement of fiat currency, you can ensure that no one bothers to save for the future... and consumes as much now as possible. even in this sub it is often mentioned that nobody would buy a coke with btc because the btc might be worth more tomorrow... and that is exactly the point. today... why wouldn't i buy a coke now when i know i can only buy half a coke in 4 years... this encourages the consumerist orgy to continue, don't save anything for the future, use it now before it is worth less. with btc when i look at that coke i can say... do i want 1 coke now, or 2 in 4 years (the rate of future value increase does decline as adoption increases, but due to the deflationary nature of bitcoin i am always incentivized to delay consumption as long as possible). to be clear... my coke consumption wouldn't drop to 0... but it does go way down.. i am still going to buy everything i need now (housing, food, etc.), and a few luxuries here and there... but overall, i am incentivized to consume less and entertain myself in other ways. this is good for the environment, and for human impact on the planet. why are we all rushing to buy that new iphone with an improvement in picture quality you'd need an electron microscope to observe? because why not... it is not like delaying the purchase till my old phone breaks earns me anything. with btc - this gets flipped on its head. i don't have a pile of cash losing value by the second that i am trying to dump in to anything.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\ntldr: btc uses alot of electricity and all other things being equal, that is likely not great for the environment, but btc also breaks the debt cycle manipulation and encourages people to use what they need now and save the rest for later instead of consuming everything as fast as possible which is great for the environment.",2,0,0,

I got into crypto about a month ago and I?m definitely doing well, and that is from tips off here alone and some common sense of course. I usually do extra research but it feels like this is where I go to verify information instead of the other way around. So that?s why I?m posting this here.\n\nThe real reason I started this venture into crypto is because a large sum of money is heading my way soon, and I?m so so lucky but I also know if I?m stupid or let that money sit there I might as well not have got it in the first place.\n\nI was wondering if it?s best to dump a nice amount into Bitcoin and Eth. I see reports everywhere claiming Bitcoin could go to 100k and Ethereum get just as close. Should I have concerns about these figures? Because I do or maybe I just don?t know enough. Of course if I took this route I?d keep some money here and there but what I really want to know is should I put it into the big boys or spread across all the new and cheaper buy ins such as cardano, ripple and a few others like that. These have worked extremely well for me over the past month but I also understand the market is good right now. I?d love to hear all suggestions any of you have to hopefully point me in the right directions so please leave anything you have been researching or think would be a good investment for the future. Thanks for your time.","decisions that could definitely change my life, please help hey everyone i just want to start off by saying this subreddit has been amazing and super informative. everyone on here seems to know their shit and are always fast to call out scams and that means a lot when your a newbie. i got into crypto about a month ago and im definitely doing well, and that is from tips off here alone and some common sense of course. i usually do extra research but it feels like this is where i go to verify information instead of the other way around. so thats why im posting this here.\n\nthe real reason i started this venture into crypto is because a large sum of money is heading my way soon, and im so so lucky but i also know if im stupid or let that money sit there i might as well not have got it in the first place.\n\ni was wondering if its best to dump a nice amount into bitcoin and eth. i see reports everywhere claiming bitcoin could go to 100k and ethereum get just as close. should i have concerns about these figures? because i do or maybe i just dont know enough. of course if i took this route id keep some money here and there but what i really want to know is should i put it into the big boys or spread across all the new and cheaper buy ins such as cardano, ripple and a few others like that. these have worked extremely well for me over the past month but i also understand the market is good right now. id love to hear all suggestions any of you have to hopefully point me in the right directions so please leave anything you have been researching or think would be a good investment for the future. thanks for your time.",2,0,0,
How I got into Crypto," Just curious to know what everyone's story on how they got interested in looking deeper into crypto currencies, blockchains and NFTs.\n\nFor me it was back in 2011 and I was addicted to this Korean style MMORPG online game as a freshman in high school. I don't remember what got me into the game but it was highly addicting. My parents unfortunately never wanted me to purchase things in the game that had to do with real money. It was sort of a Play to Win type of game and I wanted to be super OP but in order to do so I had to purchase things with real money. As a freshman in high school with no job and no money, I begged my parents to get this one thing for me but still they said no. I didn't give up though. I did google searches on how I can get these specific items for free and someone suggested Bitcoin on the game's forum. Just get some Bitcoin, convert that into in game currency, and booya I get insane stat boosted armor. My dad decided to help me out with this venture and we looked into how we could get Bitcoin and saw that Ebay users were selling Bitcoin for ""I think"" $80 a coin. But after thorough research my dad and I found that ""mining"" was another way to get free Bitcoin. There were already great YouTube tutorials on how mining can be done, but I had a super crappy laptop so there was no way I could mine on such a thing and my parents would never get me a $500 graphic card and computer. At the time, my dad and I also calculated the amount of Bitcoin we would earn along with how much electricity would be used and in the end we would be losing money by like $0.50. So in the long run, it might've been worth it if someone was Psychic but in our case, we might as well just buy that insane stat boosting armor. We gave up on this venture and my dad said ""fuck it, how much is the armor?"".\n\nMy dad and I did some great research and never really touched it again until the beginning of this year. But in the end, I learned a lot about Bitcoin and mining and still do remember those specific things that I learned today because of how interesting it was. The best of all, I got my insane stat boosting armor but unfortunately I stopped playing the game after a couple months.","how i got into crypto just curious to know what everyone is story on how they got interested in looking deeper into crypto currencies, blockchains and nfts.\n\nfor me it was back in 2011 and i was addicted to this korean style mmorpg online game as a freshman in high school. i don't remember what got me into the game but it was highly addicting. my parents unfortunately never wanted me to purchase things in the game that had to do with real money. it was sort of a play to win type of game and i wanted to be super op but in order to do so i had to purchase things with real money. as a freshman in high school with no job and no money, i begged my parents to get this one thing for me but still they said no. i didn't give up though. i did google searches on how i can get these specific items for free and someone suggested bitcoin on the game is forum. just get some bitcoin, convert that into in game currency, and booya i get insane stat boosted armor. my dad decided to help me out with this venture and we looked into how we could get bitcoin and saw that ebay users were selling bitcoin for ""i think"" $80 a coin. but after thorough research my dad and i found that ""mining"" was another way to get free bitcoin. there were already great youtube tutorials on how mining can be done, but i had a super crappy laptop so there was no way i could mine on such a thing and my parents would never get me a $500 graphic card and computer. at the time, my dad and i also calculated the amount of bitcoin we would earn along with how much electricity would be used and in the end we would be losing money by like $0.50. so in the long run, it might've been worth it if someone was psychic but in our case, we might as well just buy that insane stat boosting armor. we gave up on this venture and my dad said ""fuck it, how much is the armor?"".\n\nmy dad and i did some great research and never really touched it again until the beginning of this year. but in the end, i learned a lot about bitcoin and mining and still do remember those specific things that i learned today because of how interesting it was. the best of all, i got my insane stat boosting armor but unfortunately i stopped playing the game after a couple months.",2,0,0,

My price prediction for the coming month(s),"Donâ€™t take this post too seriously, but my last 2 long term predictions were correct lol.

How much down? I donâ€™t like guessing specific prices because thatâ€™s really reaching but I could see 6K levels.\n\n\nSo, IF bitcoin were to go down, and only IF, it might go down to low 6K levels or more. I only say if because FOMO is strong on BTC and it could shoot up to an ATH. But if bitcoin happens to act normally, it has a good chance of going pretty low, and iâ€™d bet not any lower than our previous lowest point.\n\nIf this is the case, it will likely shoot back up from the low and we will experience some sort of â€œto the moonâ€ in simpler terms. Maybe even an ATH.\n\nTake this with a grain of salt, you donâ€™t know me, but Iâ€™m not a whale with a deep scheme lol.this post will likely be deleted from the coming hate and if bitcoin does go lower, I always enjoy thinking of the people that always hate in the comments then realize I mightâ€™ve been on to something.","my price prediction for the coming month(s) donâ€™t take this post too seriously, but my last 2 long term predictions were correct lol. and i gained 10 followers in the process which is like 10k followers if you do the math. thatâ€™s all iâ€™m gonna share of myself.\n\nas i said before: i will not answer to what this is based off, i will not answer what iâ€™m using or if iâ€™m talking to anyone inside (iâ€™m not and thatâ€™s illegal lol) \nand finally, this will only work if bitcoin goes down somewhere between today and the next month or two. how much down? i donâ€™t like guessing specific prices because thatâ€™s really reaching but i could see 6k levels.\n\n\nso, if bitcoin were to go down, and only if, it might go down to low 6k levels or more. i only say if because fomo is strong on btc and it could shoot up to an ath. but if bitcoin happens to act normally, it has a good chance of going pretty low, and iâ€™d bet not any lower than our previous lowest point.\n\nif this is the case, it will likely shoot back up from the low and we will experience some sort of â€œto the moonâ€ in simpler terms. maybe even an ath.\n\ntake this with a grain of salt, you donâ€™t know me, but iâ€™m not a whale with a deep scheme lol.this post will likely be deleted from the coming hate and if bitcoin does go lower, i always enjoy thinking of the people that always hate in the comments then realize i mightâ€™ve been on to something.",2,0,0,

Decentralized v/s Centralized Gambling,"**What is Decentralized Gambling and How Does it Differ From Centralized one?**\n\nOnline gambling has been a massive industry in many countries around the world for the past decade, especially considering that various large companies have played their part in this expansion. Recently, however, a new form of online betting has begun to emerge alongside the ever-increasing relevance of cryptocurrency: decentralized gambling.\n\nAt its core, decentralized gambling is about reducing the custodial element of online gambing, with shorter waiting times for processes such as registration, deposit and withdrawal of funds, as well as giving the player more control over their own funds when gambling. This makes decentralized gabling more appetible to many users who are passionate about gambling. That being said there are also a few downsides to it. Letâ€™s start by addressing in full what decentralized gambling actually means.\n\n**How does decentralized gambling work?**\n\nDecentralized gambling is essentially a method of gambling that provides a mechanism for players to attach their cryptocurrency wallets to the operator website, therefore giving them full control over their funds at all times. These wallets are linked to blockchain technology which is the key to offering the decentralized gambling industry with security, privacy and cost-effectiveness. This is in part due to the fact that the blockchain database creates a decentralized digital and chronological record of all transactions that take place. This serves both casino operators and players well because it increases confidence in transactions that do not need to be analyzed by a third party in order to ensure fairness.\n\n**The main differences between decentralized and centralized gambling**\n\nAs stated above, the main difference is that rather than being stored on a centralized server, decentralized gambling applications are stored on a cryptoâ€™s blockchain. But what does that mean for the actual lived experience of the player? First of all, they are not dependent on gambling operators for processes and formalities such as deposits and receiving their winnings, like they would be in a normal online casino. \n\nWith crypto gambling, there is no central authority, meaning that players have full liberty on their transactions (deposits, withdrawals and fund distributions) which are, again, recorded, transparent and open to all. Players therefore do not face delays in receiving their winnings, which in decentralized gambling are released immediately by smart contracts.\n\nAnother key difference is anonymity. In centralized online casinos, players must open accounts by inserting personal details like name, address, as well as usually having to provide photo ID and a copy of credit cards. Such compliances are unnecessary in decentralized gambling as players gamble through their unique wallet address and only have to provide a name and email address.\n\n**The link between blockchain and security**\n\nAs previously implied, an elevated degree of security is one of the main attractions that decentralized gambling can offer. This is primarily due to the fact that this form of betting depends on cryptocurrency transactions. The lack of a centralized authority or third-party verification enables players to have full liberty over their transactions and ensures that there are almost no chances of fraud occurring. \n\nThis happens because all movements, including withdrawals, deposits and other fund distributions, are recorded on an instrument called the distributed ledger technology (DLT) of the blockchain, and are furthermore processed by smart contracts that can be accessed and surveyed by anyone at any time, giving the process the utmost level of transparency.\n\n[https://decentralizedgambling.io/](https://decentralizedgambling.io/)","decentralized v/s centralized gambling **what is decentralized gambling and how does it differ from centralized one?**\n\nonline gambling has been a massive industry in many countries around the world for the past decade, especially considering that various large companies have played their part in this expansion. recently, however, a new form of online betting has begun to emerge alongside the ever-increasing relevance of cryptocurrency: decentralized gambling.\n\nat its core, decentralized gambling is about reducing the custodial element of online gambing, with shorter waiting times for processes such as registration, deposit and withdrawal of funds, as well as giving the player more control over their own funds when gambling. this makes decentralized gabling more appetible to many users who are passionate about gambling. that being said there are also a few downsides to it. letâ€™s start by addressing in full what decentralized gambling actually means.\n\n**how does decentralized gambling work?**\n\ndecentralized gambling is essentially a method of gambling that provides a mechanism for players to attach their cryptocurrency wallets to the operator website, therefore giving them full control over their funds at all times. these wallets are linked to blockchain technology which is the key to offering the decentralized gambling industry with security, privacy and cost-effectiveness. this is in part due to the fact that the blockchain database creates a decentralized digital and chronological record of all transactions that take place. this serves both casino operators and players well because it increases confidence in transactions that do not need to be analyzed by a third party in order to ensure fairness.\n\n**the main differences between decentralized and centralized gambling**\n\nas stated above, the main difference is that rather than being stored on a centralized server, decentralized gambling applications are stored on a cryptoâ€™s blockchain. but what does that mean for the actual lived experience of the player? first of all, they are not dependent on gambling operators for processes and formalities such as deposits and receiving their winnings, like they would be in a normal online casino. \n\nwith crypto gambling, there is no central authority, meaning that players have full liberty on their transactions (deposits, withdrawals and fund distributions) which are, again, recorded, transparent and open to all. players therefore do not face delays in receiving their winnings, which in decentralized gambling are released immediately by smart contracts.\n\nanother key difference is anonymity. in centralized online casinos, players must open accounts by inserting personal details like name, address, as well as usually having to provide photo id and a copy of credit cards. such compliances are unnecessary in decentralized gambling as players gamble through their unique wallet address and only have to provide a name and email address.\n\n**the link between blockchain and security**\n\nas previously implied, an elevated degree of security is one of the main attractions that decentralized gambling can offer. this is primarily due to the fact that this form of betting depends on cryptocurrency transactions. the lack of a centralized authority or third-party verification enables players to have full liberty over their transactions and ensures that there are almost no chances of fraud occurring. \n\nthis happens because all movements, including withdrawals, deposits and other fund distributions, are recorded on an instrument called the distributed ledger technology (dlt) of the blockchain, and are furthermore processed by smart contracts that can be accessed and surveyed by anyone at any time, giving the process the utmost level of transparency.\n\n[",2,0,0,

Five Facts Friday,"Thought I'd try something fun and hopefully maybe inform a few people on some lesser know Crypto facts:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Bitcoin is not the first cryptocurrency.** In fact, the award goes to Digicash, which was founded years before Bitcoin came into existence. It was created by David Chaum in 1989 and is also based on cryptographic protocols, but it wasnâ€™t popular. \n2. **The US federal government spending on blockchain is predicted to reach $123.5 million by 2022**. According to blockchain statistics, this is a significant increase from $10.7 million spent in 2017. The US government and other private organizations have announced imminent plans to embark on a series of blockchain implementations into various parts of the economy and work infrastructure. *(Source: Next Gov)*\n3. **The US has the highest number of token sales ever (48%).** Since 2017, thousands of new cryptocurrencies were created. ICOs (also known as token sales) were used to raise capital for each new cryptocurrency. Statistics on cryptocurrency volume by country reveal that 48% of all token sales have come from the US, 12.78% from Singapore, and another 10.5% from the UK.  *(Source: Block Social)*  \n4. **There arenâ€™t enough bitcoins for every millionaire to own one.** According to a report by Credit Suisse, there are 46.8 million millionaires worldwide compared to only 18.5 million bitcoins in existence out of a future total of just under 21 million.                             \nThose who own 1 BTC are said to be part of the â€œ21 million club,â€ whereas those who own 21 BTC are said to be part of the â€œone in a million club.â€\n5. **The last Bitcoin is predicted to be mined by approximately the year 2140**.

"The ""Metaverse"" and VR/AR is clunky and awful right now, but Apple's first PDA ""tablet"" was an even worse experience before it all came together with the first iPhone","Behold the [Apple Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Newton), released in 1993 in all it's archaic glory!\n\nWhen this bad boy released everyone thought tablets and pocket-sized mobile computing devices were a joke.  We all thought that the kinds of mobile computing tablets they had on Star Trek The Next Generation were some sort of futuristic thing we would never see in our lifetimes, akin to the floating hoverboards or flying cars we saw in Back to the Future part II.\n\nIt's true: the user experience on these early PDA devices was truly awful.  The hardware was bulky, slow, unintuitive, poorly designed, expensive, and the software was just as bad as it had no developer ecosystem.\n\nMany people scoffed at the tech and thought it was a stupid idea that would never become mainstream.  They could never envision themselves or anyone else ever using these kinds of things en masse or outside of them being some niche toy for the obscenely rich.\n\n24 years later, after many technological advances in hardware, software, and design, the first iPhone was released and it changed everything.\n\nYes, the metaverse as it currently stands is like an Apple Newton or maybe some kind of early Palm or Blackberry device.  A niche industry which is awkward, expensive and which only a handful of enthusiasts can geek out on.\n\nIt takes a lot of time for the hardware technology, design philosophy, and software to all get developed and meld into something that really catches the public's attention.  VR/AR is even more difficult to implement well as the hardware technology is much more complex, not to mention the user design and software which all requires time to mature and grow.\n\nThere will also be many failures.  Many PDA designs failed miserably and were completely scrapped, many companies went bankrupt along with their stockholders being left holding the bag.  But the idea and the technology continued marching ahead.\n\nWhen you look at new technologies and new ideas, you need to take this sort of development time into consideration.  No one could have imagined the mobile device and software app ecosystem we have now back in 1993, or even 2003.\n\nRight now many of us are still looking at the metaverse and VR/AR like some kind of futuristic tech, like how we viewed tablets on Star Trek TNG back in the 90's.  Many of us can't imagine or see ourselves using such clunky tech with such niche use cases or scenarios.  We're still very much at the forefront of this emerging space, and the big VR/AR equivalent of the iPhone has yet to be discovered that will shift mainstream opinion of these devices.\n\nBut you can bet your crypto that there are many MANY people at work in figuring out how to make the next ""iPhone""-like paradigm shift in this space.  How long it will take and how many failures along the way remains to be seen, but those that keep up with the space and understand the direction of where things are going are going to have many golden opportunities for investment in front of them, so long as they also understand that being this early also presents many risks and pitfalls.","the ""metaverse"" and vr/ar is clunky and awful right now, but apple is first pda ""tablet"" was an even worse experience before it all came together with the first iphone behold the [apple newton]( released in 1993 in all it is archaic glory!\n\nwhen this bad boy released everyone thought tablets and pocket-sized mobile computing devices were a joke. we all thought that the kinds of mobile computing tablets they had on star trek the next generation were some sort of futuristic thing we would never see in our lifetimes, akin to the floating hoverboards or flying cars we saw in back to the future part ii.\n\nit is true: the user experience on these early pda devices was truly awful. the hardware was bulky, slow, unintuitive, poorly designed, expensive, and the software was just as bad as it had no developer ecosystem.\n\nmany people scoffed at the tech and thought it was a stupid idea that would never become mainstream. they could never envision themselves or anyone else ever using these kinds of things en masse or outside of them being some niche toy for the obscenely rich.\n\n24 years later, after many technological advances in hardware, software, and design, the first iphone was released and it changed everything.\n\nyes, the metaverse as it currently stands is like an apple newton or maybe some kind of early palm or blackberry device. a niche industry which is awkward, expensive and which only a handful of enthusiasts can geek out on.\n\nit takes a lot of time for the hardware technology, design philosophy, and software to all get developed and meld into something that really catches the public is attention. vr/ar is even more difficult to implement well as the hardware technology is much more complex, not to mention the user design and software which all requires time to mature and grow.\n\nthere will also be many failures. many pda designs failed miserably and were completely scrapped, many companies went bankrupt along with their stockholders being left holding the bag. but the idea and the technology continued marching ahead.\n\nwhen you look at new technologies and new ideas, you need to take this sort of development time into consideration. no one could have imagined the mobile device and software app ecosystem we have now back in 1993, or even 2003.\n\nright now many of us are still looking at the metaverse and vr/ar like some kind of futuristic tech, like how we viewed tablets on star trek tng back in the 90 is. many of us can't imagine or see ourselves using such clunky tech with such niche use cases or scenarios. we're still very much at the forefront of this emerging space, and the big vr/ar equivalent of the iphone has yet to be discovered that will shift mainstream opinion of these devices.\n\nbut you can bet your crypto that there are many many people at work in figuring out how to make the next ""iphone""-like paradigm shift in this space. how long it will take and how many failures along the way remains to be seen, but those that keep up with the space and understand the direction of where things are going are going to have many golden opportunities for investment in front of them, so long as they also understand that being this early also presents many risks and pitfalls.",2,0,0,

Smart contract based exchanges dont solve any problems. Change my mind.,"First off, decentralized exchanges are the future and atomic swaps are important. I understand that 100%.\n\nBut smart contract based exchanges don?t actually provide any service for non-native tokens. Lets say I want to trade some BTC for some DOGE over an Ethereum based DEX. Both of those cryptos exist on their own networks, independent of Ethereum. So I need to convert my BTC for a tokenized version, such as WBTC, and I can trade my WBTC on chain for some tokenized DOGE (lets call it WDOGE). Then I need to trade my WDOGE for actual DOGE. \n\nBTC ?? WBTC ?? WDOGE ?? DOGE.\n\nSo, the trade between WBTC and WDOGE happens atomically over the Ethereum network, but what about the trade from BTC to WBTC and the trade from WDOGE to DOGE? Those two trades are required to happen through some other medium, like a different exchange. In that case, why didnt I just trade BTC for DOGE through the other exchange in the first place? It seems that the Ethereum network simply added extra steps to the trade.\n\nAnd there is another problem. How do I know that someone wants to accept my WBTC at a 1:1 conversion to BTC. Or my WDOGE 1:1 for DOGE. I would need to trust that whatever centralized entity works to match the price of those tokens to DOGE or BTC is doing a good job. These are the issues that DeFi is trying to eliminate in the first place.\n\nThats why I think smart contract based exchanges are only useful for exchanging native tokens.\n\nSo why do I think decentralized exchanges are the future?

None that I know of have atomic transactions, but they use escrow systems instead. I just dont see a reason to use a smart contract exchange instead of something like Bisq.\n\nAm I missing something here?","smart contract based exchanges dont solve any problems. change my mind. first off, decentralized exchanges are the future and atomic swaps are important. i understand that 100%.\n\nbut smart contract based exchanges dont actually provide any service for non-native tokens. lets say i want to trade some btc for some doge over an ethereum based dex. both of those cryptos exist on their own networks, independent of ethereum. so i need to convert my btc for a tokenized version, such as wbtc, and i can trade my wbtc on chain for some tokenized doge (lets call it wdoge). then i need to trade my wdoge for actual doge. \n\nbtc wbtc wdoge doge.\n\nso, the trade between wbtc and wdoge happens atomically over the ethereum network, but what about the trade from btc to wbtc and the trade from wdoge to doge? those two trades are required to happen through some other medium, like a different exchange. in that case, why didnt i just trade btc for doge through the other exchange in the first place? it seems that the ethereum network simply added extra steps to the trade.\n\nand there is another problem. how do i know that someone wants to accept my wbtc at a 1:1 conversion to btc. or my wdoge 1:1 for doge. i would need to trust that whatever centralized entity works to match the price of those tokens to doge or btc is doing a good job. these are the issues that defi is trying to eliminate in the first place.\n\nthats why i think smart contract based exchanges are only useful for exchanging native tokens.\n\nso why do i think decentralized exchanges are the future? there exist other decentralized exchanges that allow users to trade between cryptos and even fiat without tokenization. none that i know of have atomic transactions, but they use escrow systems instead. i just dont see a reason to use a smart contract exchange instead of something like bisq.\n\nam i missing something here?",2,0,0,

Many questions to be answered in clear here. Is it okay when 90% of mining power in Bitcoin [can gather in one room](https://twitter.com/lopp/status/673398201307664384)? Is it okay when 2 or 3 mining pools control majority of hashing power, so can do censorship? Is it okay when almost all the new nodes avoid processing a blockchain from its genesis block? Is it okay when a Proof-of-Work coin developers are doing a hard-fork changing the consensus algorithm to make it GPU-friendly again? Can we summarize all the issues with decentralization? Can we cover most of issues with technical means?Decentralization is about many issues lying in many fields, of technical, social, and hybrid kinds. Researchers and developers are trying to find technical solutions, preferably, elegant and efficient. However, for many issues such solutions are not known, thus social solutions are also needed.In this article I will cover only technical aspects of decentralization, namely, decentralization of mining and decentralization of verification.## Decentralization of MiningThe two biggest concerns about decentralization of mining are specialized hardware (such as ASICs) and centralized pools.With ASICs, a big player capable to invest enough money into R;D can get unfair advantage from privately owned efficient hardware. In principle, for any kind of computational activity it is always possible to develop specialized hardware performing better than commodity computing units, such and CPUs and GPUs. However, for different computational tasks R;D efforts and possible outcome could vary a lot. Reasoning behind a search for a perfect (or close enough to perfect) could be quite complex (see e.g. 30 pages long [Equihash paper](http://ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger/article/view/48)).For most of Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies (including Bitcoin, Ethereum, ZCash), 2 to 4 centralized mining pools  control majority of mining power. This could mean easy censorship or frontrunning on applications (for example, reordering exchange orders), as in centralized pools only pool decides block candidate for the whole pool to work on. As a possible outcome, non-outsourceable mining schemes can prevent centralized pools formation. Only [Ergo Platform](https://ergoplatform.org/en/) is known for deploying a practical non-outsourceable Proof-of-Work scheme (based on a supposedly memory-harder problem from the [Equihash paper](http://ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger/article/view/48)) called [Autolykos](https://docs.ergoplatform.com/ErgoPow.pdf).As an example where social decentralization issues meet the decentralization of mining, sometimes developers of Proof-of-Work are introducing hard-forks to make a Proof-of-Work algorithm GPU-friendly again once ASICs are going to dominate in the mining market for the coin, however, it is always not quite clear why totally legit activity is banned and why developers (along with some users) can do hard-fork for this particular reason.## Decentralization of VerificationDecentralization of verification is about possibility to check validity of blockchain history. Such check provides confidence that nothing bad (i.e not conforming to a protocol) was injected to the blockchain and thus give a user a right to reject malicious chain even if it has absorbed more work than alternatives. There were many talks about such the right in the Bitcoin community when it was partly hot about User-Activated Soft Fork (UASF) idea, and recent article [ï¿½Who secures Bitcoin?""](https://medium.com/@BitcoinErrorLog/who-secures-bitcoin-95b19bbcda3c) is summarizing this way of thinking well.If verification can be done in reasonable time only by an entity able to spend millions on renting a datacenter, obviously a network is not decentralized. Ideally, it should be possible to check integrity of the whole blockchain on commodity hardware, like a decent laptop.However, new blockchains also tend to absorb more and more features, and they are not coming for free. Then the huge topic in the research community is about how to make possible to check integrity of the whole blockchain with pruned blocks or system state (or both) under plausible assumptions. Possible solutions here are about bootstrapping state snapshot and blockchain suffix on top of it (popular in Ethereum protocol clients, and formalized in [an academic paper even](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/129.pdf)), stateless clients ([partially stateless](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/994), as implemented in [Ergo Platform](https://ergoplatform.org/en/) or [fully stateless](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/968) which do exist only in research papers currently).","A New Quest for Decentralization  [https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019\_12\_12\_new\_quest/](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_12_12_new_quest/)  https://preview.redd.it/f44p1dg7jpd41.jpg?width=850;format=pjpg;auto=webp;s=49471e04d4d55450f70b5ca450f667e62fc6f354While most active conversations today in the space are about wider adoption of the blockchain technology (which often means selling out to the Wall St.) and competition with systems like Visa and Mastercard (which often means giving up with decentralization or introducing unclear security assumptions in the name of efficiency), there is the obvious need to revisit the roots of the cryptocurrency movement, which are mostly about decentralization.

My learnings after 1 week of day trading,"I plan on starting a weekly or monthly diary of my experiences as a noob day trader ""lol"". If this is interesting to you guys i will keep on going.

Community Governance in a Digital Cash Economy - Interview with DeVault,,community governance in a digital cash economy - interview with devault ,2,0,0,
"Although the concept of liquidity mining has been around for a while, it has been tepid before. However, just after the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Compound launched a new mechanism and distributed its network governance token COMP to users, liquidity mining suddenly became popular.","different priorities\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn proof-of-work mining, paying miners to prove blocks may be more important than fair distribution of tokens to market participants in DeFi. Without proofs, there would be no distributed consensus, let alone a functioning blockchain. A side effect of token distribution is that you can pre-mine empirically (some tokens on the Ethereum blockchain do) and still produce a functioning blockchain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, this priority is reversed in the Compound protocol. Technically, Compound does not need to pay liquidity providers at all to function properly, so this also alleviates some people's concerns that liquidity mining may be a ""Ponzi scheme"". COMP tokens have a positive value because liquidity mining participants who hold COMP tokens can earn fees from the protocol in the future. We can compare the distribution of COMP tokens to users with the past operations in the DeFi industry. In the past, if those early investors participated in pre-mining, they could also sell the tokens they obtained in the market later.\n\n Compound decided to distribute COMP tokens to a wider range of token holders for several reasons:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToken distribution itself can attract new users (this is the same as CPU/GPU mining in the cryptocurrency industry in attracting new users);\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCOMP tokens can vote on various changes to the Compound protocol, and because the token owners are so large, the community is less likely to bypass Byzantine Fault Tolerance or implement short-term changes that used to be highly centered occur on the entity of the transformation;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is easier to convince regulators that COMP tokens are not securities when users make money by working with each other rather than paying token users back to early investors.\n\nDifferent implementations\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first thing to note here is that both Bitcoin and Compound have a certain degree of control over their actions when executing rewards. Through this ""control"", both Bitcoin and Compound can create specific incentives for miners.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Bitcoin, the incentive is for miners to include and validate as many transactions as possible, while also requiring miners to keep mining at the top of the blockchain. In general, the mechanisms of positive workload, block producers, timestamps, and incentives make Bitcoin a trustless electronic cash system. Bitcoin requires miners to follow this specific strategy to secure the network, also known as Nakamoto Consensus.\n\nHowever, scholars such as Eyal published a paper in 2013 that Nakamoto consensus may not be perfect. He proposed a strategy called ""selfish mining"" (Selfish Mining), which can allow a few mining pools to obtain more money than they honestly perform mining. Mining protocol for more benefits. Under this strategy, ""selfish mining"" will potentially destabilize Bitcoin and promote mining centralization. Although there is no clear evidence of selfish mining in the market, the risk is always there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn contrast, Compoundâ€™s optimal incentive strategy for liquidity miners has changed a lot and made many improvements. Compound is able to do this because their liquidity miners have a lot of incentive strategies to choose from - after all users need to pay a certain amount of COMP tokens for (almost) any action they want to take in the Compound protocol.\n\nIn fact, the Compound protocol is designed this way because the priority of the Compound protocol is not to incentivize specific behaviors on the network (such as Bitcoin miners mining is a specific behavior, and they also earn BTC for mining Token Rewards), Compound's purpose is to provide tokens to a large number of users. Here, letâ€™s look at a counter-example: Synthetix, the DeFi protocol that uses its token SNX in a more targeted way. In order to defend the peg of the synthetic stablecoin SNX, the Synthetix protocol will provide incentives for those who add liquidity to the Dai/USDC/USDT/sUSD pool on Curve (i.e. ""liquidity providers"").\n\nHowever, for a period of time, BAT, the currency with the best COMP liquidity mining revenue, almost monopolized COMP mining. Generally speaking, the higher the deposit rate, the more efficient COMP mining will be, but miners will basically stick to the incentives as their share of the COMP token reward is based on the interest paid. Unilaterally increasing the scale of BAT deposits cannot increase the interest rate, because the factor that directly affects the interest rate is the loan ratio. As a result, large BAT users deposit other assets in their accounts, and continue to increase the scale of mortgage until all the previously deposited BAT is lent. This kind of The model has also become ""interest paid while receiving interest"", which ultimately pushes up the capital utilization rate, and leads to the marginalization of mainstream assets that use ""real"" asset supply and lending, and thus cannot obtain due incentives.\n\nSummarize\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the problems mentioned above, Compound quickly patched up the issuance mechanism, but the question seems to still exist, namely: Is there an optimal incentive strategy that can be replaced? Indeed, Compound does not have a ""Nakamoto Consensus"" nor a strategy that miners are explicitly required to follow, and they may hope that at least some rewards will not be captured by anomalous strategies. Simple users who deposit USDC and USDT in Compound are like the easiest and most stable flow of funds in the existing banking system, anyway, a cryptocurrency system like Compound can ""attract"" billions of bank deposits Coming in was definitely a huge success.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, whether it is liquidity mining or positive workload, these mechanisms ultimately need to be weighed. Rather than implementing a very specific incentive strategy and then building a distributed protocol around that strategy, we may need to prioritize the protocol from the mining side - this way, many actions on the network can be rewarded and ""stimulated"" more. Multiple possible incentive strategies emerge.","although the concept of liquidity mining has been around for a while, it has been tepid before. however, just after the decentralized finance (defi) protocol compound launched a new mechanism and distributed its network governance token comp to users, liquidity mining suddenly became popular. different priorities\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nin proof-of-work mining, paying miners to prove blocks may be more important than fair distribution of tokens to market participants in defi. without proofs, there would be no distributed consensus, let alone a functioning blockchain. a side effect of token distribution is that you can pre-mine empirically (some tokens on the ethereum blockchain do) and still produce a functioning blockchain.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nhowever, this priority is reversed in the compound protocol. technically, compound does not need to pay liquidity providers at all to function properly, so this also alleviates some people is concerns that liquidity mining may be a ""ponzi scheme"". comp tokens have a positive value because liquidity mining participants who hold comp tokens can earn fees from the protocol in the future. we can compare the distribution of comp tokens to users with the past operations in the defi industry. in the past, if those early investors participated in pre-mining, they could also sell the tokens they obtained in the market later.\n\n compound decided to distribute comp tokens to a wider range of token holders for several reasons:\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\ntoken distribution itself can attract new users (this is the same as cpu/gpu mining in the cryptocurrency industry in attracting new users);\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\ncomp tokens can vote on various changes to the compound protocol, and because the token owners are so large, the community is less likely to bypass byzantine fault tolerance or implement short-term changes that used to be highly centered occur on the entity of the transformation;\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nit is easier to convince regulators that comp tokens are not securities when users make money by working with each other rather than paying token users back to early investors.\n\ndifferent implementations\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nthe first thing to note here is that both bitcoin and compound have a certain degree of control over their actions when executing rewards. through this ""control"", both bitcoin and compound can create specific incentives for miners.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nin bitcoin, the incentive is for miners to include and validate as many transactions as possible, while also requiring miners to keep mining at the top of the blockchain. in general, the mechanisms of positive workload, block producers, timestamps, and incentives make bitcoin a trustless electronic cash system. bitcoin requires miners to follow this specific strategy to secure the network, also known as nakamoto consensus.\n\nhowever, scholars such as eyal published a paper in 2013 that nakamoto consensus may not be perfect. he proposed a strategy called ""selfish mining"" (selfish mining), which can allow a few mining pools to obtain more money than they honestly perform mining. mining protocol for more benefits. under this strategy, ""selfish mining"" will potentially destabilize bitcoin and promote mining centralization. although there is no clear evidence of selfish mining in the market, the risk is always there.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nin contrast, compoundâ€™s optimal incentive strategy for liquidity miners has changed a lot and made many improvements. compound is able to do this because their liquidity miners have a lot of incentive strategies to choose from - after all users need to pay a certain amount of comp tokens for (almost) any action they want to take in the compound protocol.\n\nin fact, the compound protocol is designed this way because the priority of the compound protocol is not to incentivize specific behaviors on the network (such as bitcoin miners mining is a specific behavior, and they also earn btc for mining token rewards), compound is purpose is to provide tokens to a large number of users. here, letâ€™s look at a counter-example: synthetix, the defi protocol that uses its token snx in a more targeted way. in order to defend the peg of the synthetic stablecoin snx, the synthetix protocol will provide incentives for those who add liquidity to the dai/usdc/usdt/susd pool on curve (i.e. ""liquidity providers"").\n\nhowever, for a period of time, bat, the currency with the best comp liquidity mining revenue, almost monopolized comp mining. generally speaking, the higher the deposit rate, the more efficient comp mining will be, but miners will basically stick to the incentives as their share of the comp token reward is based on the interest paid. unilaterally increasing the scale of bat deposits cannot increase the interest rate, because the factor that directly affects the interest rate is the loan ratio. as a result, large bat users deposit other assets in their accounts, and continue to increase the scale of mortgage until all the previously deposited bat is lent. this kind of the model has also become ""interest paid while receiving interest"", which ultimately pushes up the capital utilization rate, and leads to the marginalization of mainstream assets that use ""real"" asset supply and lending, and thus cannot obtain due incentives.\n\nsummarize\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nfor the problems mentioned above, compound quickly patched up the issuance mechanism, but the question seems to still exist, namely: is there an optimal incentive strategy that can be replaced? indeed, compound does not have a ""nakamoto consensus"" nor a strategy that miners are explicitly required to follow, and they may hope that at least some rewards will not be captured by anomalous strategies. simple users who deposit usdc and usdt in compound are like the easiest and most stable flow of funds in the existing banking system, anyway, a cryptocurrency system like compound can ""attract"" billions of bank deposits coming in was definitely a huge success.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nof course, whether it is liquidity mining or positive workload, these mechanisms ultimately need to be weighed. rather than implementing a very specific incentive strategy and then building a distributed protocol around that strategy, we may need to prioritize the protocol from the mining side - this way, many actions on the network can be rewarded and ""stimulated"" more. multiple possible incentive strategies emerge.",2,0,0,

How to win friends and Influence the /CryptoCurrency community,"Having trouble navigating the sea of crap? Feeling overwhelmed with the same memes and FUD and FOMO post after post?\n\nYou're in luck! There's a better way to browse the /r/cryptocurrency subreddit! Here are some quick tips for not driving yourself insane navigating and interacting with this silly place.\n\n1. Sort by New\n\n 	In my opinion a lot of the best discussions on this subreddit are contained within smaller posts with a more narrow topic. Sort by new, and engage in these threads. Just because it's not going to hit the front page doesn't mean there is nothing to gain or share from smaller less popular threads. Especially if you have something to add! Just because a thread has 20 votes and only 10 comments doesn't mean the quality of information there is low. Quite the opposite as far as I've experienced.\n\n2. Ignore what doesn't interest you\n\n		Sick of the 20 doge or Elon posts per hour? Ignore them. Scroll past and pretend it's not there. Learn to skim the page and identify the topics you are here to discuss, or the news and information that grabs your interest. After a while it becomes instinct to zip past all the hot garbage and pick out the threads you like. Comments too.. just blast right past it. It won't get on your nerves if you don't stop to read it.\n\n3. Post when you are knowledgeable\n\n	See someone posting a misconception? Did someone ask a question you know the answer to? Is there something people are failing to bring up that you believe is important? Engage. Share, help new people or even vets that maybe don't know much about that specific topic. It usually does not go without appreciation. \n\n4. Share your perspective.\n\n	Our most valuable resource here is your honest opinion. The more people we have choosing to engage and share their perspective, the less power shills, undue FUD, and undue FOMO have to sway the narrative. Don't be afraid to post something that you think might draw criticism, share your perspective so we can all get a more accurate picture of what people are thinking and feeling. Try not to be concerned about possible negative karma, even karmaless comments can spark a discussion and IMO that's a good thing. And remember that you don't have to have a debate in order to share perspectives with someone who disagrees with you. \n\n5. Post when you want to know more\n\n		There is no shame in asking a question. If someone(s) is talking about something you don't quite understand ask.. expand the conversation. I guarantee there are other people who had the same question that just won't ask.. It helps everyone to have deeper discussions.\n\n6. Be yourself\n\n	I generally believe if more people were simply themselves on here the overall quality would improve. The more we engage honestly the better the experience will for all.. and I think the experience is better for the individual poster too.\n\n6b. Unless you're a complete dick\n\n	There is generally a fine balance between tolerable and intolerable levels of dickishness. Find your balance if you know that you can be abrasive.. unless you're a complete dick in which case you probably don't care so continue on. Most people won't have too much trouble with 6b and can disregard it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr; Engage honestly, sort by new, and participate in smaller posts even though they won't shower you with moons and karma.  This all applies to any popular subreddit as well... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are just some tips from my perspective, please share anything you have to add.","how to win friends and influence the /cryptocurrency community having trouble navigating the sea of crap? feeling overwhelmed with the same memes and fud and fomo post after post?\n\nyou're in luck! there is a better way to browse the /r/cryptocurrency subreddit! here are some quick tips for not driving yourself insane navigating and interacting with this silly place.\n\n1. sort by new\n\n 	in my opinion a lot of the best discussions on this subreddit are contained within smaller posts with a more narrow topic. sort by new, and engage in these threads. just because it is not going to hit the front page doesn't mean there is nothing to gain or share from smaller less popular threads. especially if you have something to add! just because a thread has 20 votes and only 10 comments doesn't mean the quality of information there is low. quite the opposite as far as i've experienced.\n\n2. ignore what doesn't interest you\n\n		sick of the 20 doge or elon posts per hour? ignore them. scroll past and pretend it is not there. learn to skim the page and identify the topics you are here to discuss, or the news and information that grabs your interest. after a while it becomes instinct to zip past all the hot garbage and pick out the threads you like. comments too.. just blast right past it. it won't get on your nerves if you don't stop to read it.\n\n3. post when you are knowledgeable\n\n	see someone posting a misconception? did someone ask a question you know the answer to? is there something people are failing to bring up that you believe is important? engage. share, help new people or even vets that maybe don't know much about that specific topic. it usually does not go without appreciation. \n\n4. share your perspective.\n\n	our most valuable resource here is your honest opinion. the more people we have choosing to engage and share their perspective, the less power shills, undue fud, and undue fomo have to sway the narrative. don't be afraid to post something that you think might draw criticism, share your perspective so we can all get a more accurate picture of what people are thinking and feeling. try not to be concerned about possible negative karma, even karmaless comments can spark a discussion and imo that is a good thing. and remember that you don't have to have a debate in order to share perspectives with someone who disagrees with you. \n\n5. post when you want to know more\n\n		there is no shame in asking a question. if someone(s) is talking about something you don't quite understand ask.. expand the conversation. i guarantee there are other people who had the same question that just won't ask.. it helps everyone to have deeper discussions.\n\n6. be yourself\n\n	i generally believe if more people were simply themselves on here the overall quality would improve. the more we engage honestly the better the experience will for all.. and i think the experience is better for the individual poster too.\n\n6b. unless you're a complete dick\n\n	there is generally a fine balance between tolerable and intolerable levels of dickishness. find your balance if you know that you can be abrasive.. unless you're a complete dick in which case you probably don't care so continue on. most people won't have too much trouble with 6b and can disregard it.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\ntldr; engage honestly, sort by new, and participate in smaller posts even though they won't shower you with moons and karma. this all applies to any popular subreddit as well... \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nthese are just some tips from my perspective, please share anything you have to add.",2,0,0,

"Pro tip: Dont buy the ""easy"" way!","Hello, just wanted to give the community a heads up when buying their crypto. This PSA is about getting more crypto for your buck. It may seem like a small savings, but it could be a lot of money over the years buying the ""easy"" way.\n\nFor example, on some exchanges when you buy a token directly, they charge a random fee that can be from $1 to some crazy percentage like +4%. Not only are you paying that fee, but most likely you are buying the token well over market price. I have seen some mark it a baffling 10% over market price, absolutely disgusting way to take customers money imo. At least let us know how much  you are gonna screw us on the mark-up. \n\nAnyway, there is a way around these fees. For most exchanges you buy directly, you can also trade on order books. For example, coinbase also has coinbase pro (BinanceUS, Kraken, OKcoin are others, not trying to hype CB) where you can instead deposit usd for free or a very small fee, then trade it for your token and pay a takers fee of around **0.5% or less**. \n\nSpot trading also let's you buy the coin at market price and pay a very reasonable fee, saving you so much on fees over time. If this is something new to you, I encourage you to try and learn how to buy/sell from order books. It's very easy to use, the hard part is if you are making the right choice buying/selling.\n\nTL;DR: If you want a fair price, always try to buy straight from order books if you can. Every other way is ripping you off.","pro tip: dont buy the ""easy"" way! hello, just wanted to give the community a heads up when buying their crypto. this psa is about getting more crypto for your buck. it may seem like a small savings, but it could be a lot of money over the years buying the ""easy"" way.\n\nfor example, on some exchanges when you buy a token directly, they charge a random fee that can be from $1 to some crazy percentage like +4%. not only are you paying that fee, but most likely you are buying the token well over market price. i have seen some mark it a baffling 10% over market price, absolutely disgusting way to take customers money imo. at least let us know how much you are gonna screw us on the mark-up. \n\nanyway, there is a way around these fees. for most exchanges you buy directly, you can also trade on order books. for example, coinbase also has coinbase pro (binanceus, kraken, okcoin are others, not trying to hype cb) where you can instead deposit usd for free or a very small fee, then trade it for your token and pay a takers fee of around **0.5% or less**. \n\nspot trading also let is you buy the coin at market price and pay a very reasonable fee, saving you so much on fees over time. if this is something new to you, i encourage you to try and learn how to buy/sell from order books. it is very easy to use, the hard part is if you are making the right choice buying/selling.\n\ntl;dr: if you want a fair price, always try to buy straight from order books if you can. every other way is ripping you off.",2,0,0,

Taxes on Crypto in the US,"Hello everyone!\n\nI am new to crypto and I would like to make sure I understand the tax implications regarding different buying, selling, and trading strategies sooner rather than later. I apologize if this type of questions if fairly common, but I cannot seem to find answers to these specific questions on this subreddit or google.\n\nI understand that in the US, crypto is considered ""property"" and is subject to capital gains tax. I also understand that, depending on how long you held it before you turned around and sold your crypto, the tax rate could be relatively small or fairly high. For these purposes, I keep track of all of my crypto transactions. What I DON'T understand are the following:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Do you have to pay any taxes at all on the value of your crypto if you haven't sold it?** The statement above regarding how much you are taxed depending on when you sell seems to suggest not, but I can't seem to get a direct answer from the internet (unless I am not using the correct search term).\n   * As an example, let's say I were to buy $100 worth of BTC right now and hold it for 5 years. After 5 years, the value has increased to $2,000. How much, if any, do I owe in taxes each year for those 5 years of holding? Am I only taxed on the $1,900 profit after I sell?\n* **Do you pay taxes on exchanging between different types of crypto?** Do these tax rates change depending on which types of crypto are involved in the exchange (e.g., is a BTC &lt;--&gt; ETH exchange taxed differently than a USDC &lt;--&gt; XLM exchange)?\n   * I like examples so here is another. Which of the following scenarios is preferable from a tax perspective? (1) You buy $100 worth of BTC directly. (2) You buy $100 worth of USDC, wait for a dip, and then exchange all of your USDC for BTC, minus a few bucks in fees. \n* **Are there taxes involved in sending and/or receiving crypto between different wallets owned by the same person?**\n   * My current wallet of Exodus, but since it only allows you to buy BTC directly, I have been also using Coinbase to buy other types of crypto, which I then send to my Exodus wallet. In addition to whatever taxes I have to pay on the buying/holding said crypto in Coinbase, am I also paying taxes on sending this crypto to my Exodus wallet? In short, is this strategy ill-advised or just fine?\n* **Is there an optimal buying/holding/selling/exchanging/sending strategy from a tax perspective?** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you in advance for your responses!","taxes on crypto in the us hello everyone!\n\ni am new to crypto and i would like to make sure i understand the tax implications regarding different buying, selling, and trading strategies sooner rather than later. i apologize if this type of questions if fairly common, but i cannot seem to find answers to these specific questions on this subreddit or google.\n\ni understand that in the us, crypto is considered ""property"" and is subject to capital gains tax. i also understand that, depending on how long you held it before you turned around and sold your crypto, the tax rate could be relatively small or fairly high. for these purposes, i keep track of all of my crypto transactions. what i don't understand are the following:\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n* **do you have to pay any taxes at all on the value of your crypto if you haven't sold it?** the statement above regarding how much you are taxed depending on when you sell seems to suggest not, but i can't seem to get a direct answer from the internet (unless i am not using the correct search term).\n * as an example, let is say i were to buy $100 worth of btc right now and hold it for 5 years. after 5 years, the value has increased to $2,000. how much, if any, do i owe in taxes each year for those 5 years of holding? am i only taxed on the $1,900 profit after i sell?\n* **do you pay taxes on exchanging between different types of crypto?** do these tax rates change depending on which types of crypto are involved in the exchange (e.g., is a btc &lt;--&gt; eth exchange taxed differently than a usdc &lt;--&gt; xlm exchange)?\n * i like examples so here is another. which of the following scenarios is preferable from a tax perspective?

(2) you buy $100 worth of usdc, wait for a dip, and then exchange all of your usdc for btc, minus a few bucks in fees. \n* **are there taxes involved in sending and/or receiving crypto between different wallets owned by the same person?**\n * my current wallet of exodus, but since it only allows you to buy btc directly, i have been also using coinbase to buy other types of crypto, which i then send to my exodus wallet. in addition to whatever taxes i have to pay on the buying/holding said crypto in coinbase, am i also paying taxes on sending this crypto to my exodus wallet? in short, is this strategy ill-advised or just fine?\n* **is there an optimal buying/holding/selling/exchanging/sending strategy from a tax perspective?** \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nthank you in advance for your responses!",2,0,0,

Just a little thought about goals before bedtime.,"I do believe if someone has invested majority of their money that this brings bigger emotions and pushes these people to sell whenever bigger correction happens . But just rethink your goal. If you are investing in coins that have potential and truly can change something , rather than potential moonshots , ask yourself what do you want ? Of course to get rich but remember that investing is also gambling as nobody can predict the future . We have obvious correction that might be a dip considering that market has already proved its potential in short term. If you believe that there are big whales manipulating market , then why can't they manipulate it so the prices will go up and they will make a lot of money as they bought this dip. However I want you to not think too much about numbers. As you can see at the moment crypto is very dynamic and can change a lot in week's time. But look at the bigger picture , zoom out. Make yourself a time goal instead of gain. If you going to chase 10x profit it might never happen . Look at top 20 cryptos and compare their prices 3 months ago . I wasn't here back in 2017 or 18 but I'm sure if you were in red back then  and moved forward 12 months you made a nice profit . So why not wait 12 months from now ? Make sure you got your passwords etc safe so you won't loose your account. Follow market on app like coingecko , where you cant see your portfolio and how much you have. Focus on something that you haven't had time to do in last months . Maybe change your Reddit main Paige to top posts in last week or month, so you won't be hooked up to everyday drama and short term fomo. Honestly if you have put effort in research about your coin and believe in it I do as well. If you're in red atm I believe is temporary and you will get your gains sooner or later. There is so many exciting things coming up later this year regarding crypto. Just an example look how much Eth gained after its last update and how rapid it was . Just wait , set a goal for at least few months and dont sell If you haven't made a profit no matter what . Only buy more when you think it is a good time and you have money obviously. I've been through many little dips and a lot of aths and just been 4 months. This post is already longer than expected . I just don't want you to get depressed because of some short term situations. Always look at w bigger picture and in the end it is just a money . I hope someone will get my point . And if you made it that far- thank you.

Make your own decisions,"I've been playing around with crypto since 2016. Only since after 2018s bull run I joined with a few grand in it. I am glad to say that I followed my instinct and looked ar previous bull runs. I came out with 7x my initial money. Which I will spread out on the most popular crypto after the price drops to normal. \n\nWhats my point here? I TRIED following crypto youtubers, followed twitter crypto ""analysts"". But there is never a reality check. Everything related to crypto is only shilling and delusion. If I had listened to these idiots I would have lost any and all potential profit. The crypto community is nothing more than addicted gamblers. \n\nThe best tool to get a reality check is check 2018 Jan-Mar reddit posts through the internet archive. You will see the same ""iTs JuSt A dIp"" posts. Its not just a dip. We're returning to normal. \n\nTo the people asking for if it's the right time to invest:\n1. No\n2. No\n3.

Thank you r/CrytoCurrency,"I got into Crypto in a really stupid amateurish way. I didn't have a clue what I was doing, I just opened an etoro account and started buying coins I'd heard of - Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano. They were doing OK, but I saw other coins shooting up in profit so I started buying any old coin - most at ATH! But then I joined this sub, I read posts on here and ask a few questions and realised I had been such a noob. \n\nWe had the last few months where everything was low and that gave me a chance to seriously look at what I was doing and make changes. A few of you told me about Kraken, so I opened a Kraken account and bought some coins while they were low and started selling my etoro coins and adding more to Kraken. \n\nThen I kept reading about staking, I couldn't work out how to do it so I left it for a while - I wish I hadn't. A long post about staking last week made me determined to work out how to do it. I realised that I needed to log into Kraken on the browser rather than my phone app so I staked everything I could. Now I'm seeing earnings come in from that and it feels great! Extra crypto for doing nothing! \n\nSo thank you r/CrytoCurrency you have taught me all I know about investing in crypto, without you I think I would have given up and sold. I still have loads to learn but now I'm DCA,  hodling and staking I feel confident to continue.\n\nGood luck to all those who are new and here to learn, it's a big learning curve but there are so many helpful people in this group who will help you on the journey.","thank you r/crytocurrency i got into crypto in a really stupid amateurish way. i didn't have a clue what i was doing, i just opened an etoro account and started buying coins i'd heard of - bitcoin, ethereum, cardano. they were doing ok, but i saw other coins shooting up in profit so i started buying any old coin - most at ath! but then i joined this sub, i read posts on here and ask a few questions and realised i had been such a noob. \n\nwe had the last few months where everything was low and that gave me a chance to seriously look at what i was doing and make changes. a few of you told me about kraken, so i opened a kraken account and bought some coins while they were low and started selling my etoro coins and adding more to kraken. \n\nthen i kept reading about staking, i couldn't work out how to do it so i left it for a while - i wish i hadn't. a long post about staking last week made me determined to work out how to do it. i realised that i needed to log into kraken on the browser rather than my phone app so i staked everything i could. now i'm seeing earnings come in from that and it feels great! extra crypto for doing nothing! \n\nso thank you r/crytocurrency you have taught me all i know about investing in crypto, without you i think i would have given up and sold. i still have loads to learn but now i'm dca, hodling and staking i feel confident to continue.\n\ngood luck to all those who are new and here to learn, it is a big learning curve but there are so many helpful people in this group who will help you on the journey.",2,0,0,
Donating millions in cryptocurrencies to a nonprofit foundation,"There is a lot to this but I'll try to keep it short.\n\nOver the last year, I have made several investments into early cryptocurrencies that have paid off far beyond anything I imagined, and I'm now sitting on millions of dollars of assets.\n\nMy girlfriend (and soon-to-be-wife) and I have always felt a calling to help the homeless and marginalized populations, and to fight against human trafficking in our area, so we decided to start a private nonprofit foundation for those purposes, and to donate 90%+ of the cryptocurrencies to it.\n\nThe situation is quite complicated and there are many nuances we are considering, but the most sizeable asset we have is currently on a vesting schedule and won't be fully unlocked until next year.

Dogecoin Caused Me To Actually Learn About Crypto,"As most of you know, Dogecoin has been getting pumped up with a lot of press, social media, and celebrities. When I saw people investing in Dogecoin, I had no idea what it was, but since it seemed I might be able to make a few dollars, I chose to buy in. I was on the DOGE train for a good bit, but then I started asking myself ?why is this not going to the moon yet? and ?what makes this coin different from Bitcoin?. When I started to ask myself those questions, I started to really dive deep into what cryptocurrency is and why it?s important. I read docs for various coins, listened to podcasts, and bought my first wallet (previously was using Robinhood). \n\nNow, I?m really hyped about coins like Eth/Eth2.0, Cardano, and I?m currently looking into VeChain, since working in the tech scene I feel I could help build out applications using these platforms. I understand that Dogecoin, while a great meme coin, doesn?t have anything really advancing it. It?s similar to a pump and dump, which is okay, just not something I want to be a part of anymore.

Glad to be a part of this community and to keep learning along the way!","dogecoin caused me to actually learn about crypto as most of you know, dogecoin has been getting pumped up with a lot of press, social media, and celebrities. when i saw people investing in dogecoin, i had no idea what it was, but since it seemed i might be able to make a few dollars, i chose to buy in. i was on the doge train for a good bit, but then i started asking myself why is this not going to the moon yet and what makes this coin different from bitcoin. when i started to ask myself those questions, i started to really dive deep into what cryptocurrency is and why its important. i read docs for various coins, listened to podcasts, and bought my first wallet (previously was using robinhood). \n\nnow, im really hyped about coins like eth/eth2.0, cardano, and im currently looking into vechain, since working in the tech scene i feel i could help build out applications using these platforms. i understand that dogecoin, while a great meme coin, doesnt have anything really advancing it. its similar to a pump and dump, which is okay, just not something i want to be a part of anymore. sadly, i know from talking to family and friends, they now lump everything crypto wise to being a get-rich-quick scheme because of these actions. im in it for the long haul now, excited to see more adoption take place and improve peoples lives. glad to be a part of this community and to keep learning along the way!",2,0,0,

Combatting FOMO when it comes to selling altcoins,"The bulk of my crypto is BTC followed by ETH, with a slice of BCH and some BNB that I use for spending.\n\nHowever, I have additional crypto (altcoins or shitcoins, depending on your point of view) which I'm looking to sell for cash.

crypto tax software bug,"My name is Sung Hwang.  I wanted to share my negative experience with [cryptotrader.tax](https://cryptotrader.tax).  I think [t](https://cryptotrader.tax)he company changed its name to Coinledger.  In short, it is about two defects, bugs, I found in their tax software in 2021.  \n\n	In 2021, I used their free version online tax calculation service.  I found two bugs in their software.  I can say conclusively that I found bugs in their tax software because I notified them by email about the bugs and later they emailed me back and acknowledged the bugs.       \n\n	Here were the two bugs.  1.  Their software processed some of my coin purchases as income.  It would have raised my tax because having crypto income means I had to pay income tax.   2.  Their software did not add some of my coin selling fees to the cost basis.  So, that also would've raised my tax.     \n\n	I understand software have bugs.  Although it took two months, they eventually fixed the bugs as far as I can tell.  But here is the problem, by the time the bugs were supposedly fixed, it was August 2021, 4 months after the regular tax season was over.  There had to many people who were affected by their software and paid more tax than they had to as a result.  Despite my repeated request to the company, they seemed to be refusing to notify their customers who were affected by the bugs.  Here is my detailed email exchanges with them.      \n\n	In august 2021, after they asked me to test their software again to confirm the bugs were fixed.  I think it worked correctly.  Then I emailed them asking them if they were going to notify their affected customers about the bugs. And here is what they wrote in their reply email on Aug 27, 2021, 11:01 AM\n\n""I appreciate the concern here and yes, we do plan to notify our customers so that they can re-import their data for Kraken. We follow a standard practice for this in which our dev team runs an affected user analysis and then we will send an outreach by email to all the affected users. We are committed to addressing any errors and helping our customers to get the correct calculations. Thank you for reaching out about this issue and for providing evidence that made it very easy to escalate and then resolve the bug. Please let me know if you have any more feedback or concerns that I can share with our team.""\n\n	Right away, I replied asking when they were going to send out the notification.  And here is what they wrote in the reply email on Sep 6, 2021, 11:52 AM\n\n	""Thanks for following up in this. Our engineers are running a query in the production database to determine all the affected users, and then our David, our CEO will be sending out a message. This should be completed by the end of this week. The good news is that based on the the initial survey from our integrations team, this bug was detected pretty early and only affects a fraction of Kraken users. I'll be sure to message you directly once the email has gone out.""\n\n	One month later, I emailed asking for an update.  They replied as below on Sep 28, 2021, 9:47 AM\n\n	""Thanks for checking in about this. It has taken a bit longer than expected to run the query in our production database as we want to extra thorough in collecting all affected users. We should have this completed within the next week.

What is Monero and Why it is key on reaching absolute Anonymity and Privacy on Crypto," \n\n\#What Is Monero (XMR)?\n\nMonero is just like every other crypto which makes it digital currency. The main difference between Monero and every other Cryptocurrency is the fact that Monero is fungible and can't be linked to any user or identity. The term fungible refers to a currency where every unit is identical and mutually interchangeable with another unit of the same value. So Bitcoin received from the illegal transaction can be distinguished from a Bitcoin bought on Coinbase or Binance through blockchain analysis, two separate Monero coins transacted from darknet or Binance appear exactly the same and can't be distinguished. This is the reason financial regulators can trace Bitcoin transactions but not XMR payments.\n\n\#How Does Monero (XMR) Work?\n\nMonero is able to maintain privacy and anonymity through these two important processes: Stealth addresses and Ring signature\n\nStealth addresses allow the sender to create a public address on behalf of the recipient for every single transaction. So every transaction is able to create its own public address to maintain privacy and anonymity. Every Monero user can generate a private view key and a private spend key. The private view key allows the user to see transactions within their account but is unable to transact with it. While the private spend key allows them to authorize payments and transactions\n\nRing signatures is a concept from cryptography which means that the signature can be signed by any member of a specific group of people who possess private keys. Every time someone makes a XMR transaction, the Monero wallet forms a ring from other users' keys it pulls from the blockchain. It makes it impossible for people observing which and whose keys were being used to sign. Furthermore, in January 2017, Monero introduced RingCT which hides the value of transactions.\n\n\#What Makes Monero (XMR) Unique?\n\nMonero has anonymous developers and open-source code. It may sound similar to Bitcoin but there are major differences, most notably by the way updates and forks are handled. Monero's software is programmed to update every six months autonomously unlike Bitcoin which is somewhat reluctant when it comes to forks or updates.\n\nFor Monero users, the value of Monero comes from its privacy and anonymity. It liberates Monero users to transact whenever and for whatever reason they want without being able to be observed by anyone. In addition to that, a lot of its investors believe that demand for privacy will increase over time and drive up the price of the XMR itself.\n\n\#What Is the Supply of Monero (XMR)?\n\nMonero (XMR) currently has a circulating supply of 18,004,702 XMR. It will reach a total supply of 18.4 million XMR by May 2022. There is no max supply in the Monero blockchain and it will continue to produce 0.6 XMR per block infinitely to incentivize the miners.\n\n\#Conclusion\n\nWhile Bitcoin will always pioneers the crypto industry as being the first digital currency ever created. Monero differentiates itself from other cryptos by being the most private and achieved financial anonymity. Although there are a few other privacy coins available on the market, Monero is able to differentiate itself by features such as stealth addresses and ring signatures, plus the ASIC resistance, and able to become the biggest privacy coin by market cap.\n\nThe Monero (XMR) success is also driven by the fact that the community itself is driven more by ideals of complete anonymity should be a fundamental right rather than pursue of profits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHelpful Links\n\n[https://www.getmonero.org/](https://www.getmonero.org/)\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/tech/introduction-monero-xmr/](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/introduction-monero-xmr/)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/13/what-is-monero-new-cryptocurrency-of-choice-for-cyber-criminals.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/13/what-is-monero-new-cryptocurrency-of-choice-for-cyber-criminals.html)\n\n[https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-monero-xmr](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-monero-xmr)\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/monero/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/monero/)","what is monero and why it is key on reaching absolute anonymity and privacy on crypto \n\n\#what is monero (xmr)?\n\nmonero is just like every other crypto which makes it digital currency. the main difference between monero and every other cryptocurrency is the fact that monero is fungible and can't be linked to any user or identity. the term fungible refers to a currency where every unit is identical and mutually interchangeable with another unit of the same value. so bitcoin received from the illegal transaction can be distinguished from a bitcoin bought on coinbase or binance through blockchain analysis, two separate monero coins transacted from darknet or binance appear exactly the same and can't be distinguished. this is the reason financial regulators can trace bitcoin transactions but not xmr payments.\n\n\#how does monero (xmr) work?\n\nmonero is able to maintain privacy and anonymity through these two important processes: stealth addresses and ring signature\n\nstealth addresses allow the sender to create a public address on behalf of the recipient for every single transaction. so every transaction is able to create its own public address to maintain privacy and anonymity. every monero user can generate a private view key and a private spend key. the private view key allows the user to see transactions within their account but is unable to transact with it. while the private spend key allows them to authorize payments and transactions\n\nring signatures is a concept from cryptography which means that the signature can be signed by any member of a specific group of people who possess private keys. every time someone makes a xmr transaction, the monero wallet forms a ring from other users' keys it pulls from the blockchain. it makes it impossible for people observing which and whose keys were being used to sign. furthermore, in january 2017, monero introduced ringct which hides the value of transactions.\n\n\#what makes monero (xmr) unique?\n\nmonero has anonymous developers and open-source code. it may sound similar to bitcoin but there are major differences, most notably by the way updates and forks are handled. monero is software is programmed to update every six months autonomously unlike bitcoin which is somewhat reluctant when it comes to forks or updates.\n\nfor monero users, the value of monero comes from its privacy and anonymity. it liberates monero users to transact whenever and for whatever reason they want without being able to be observed by anyone. in addition to that, a lot of its investors believe that demand for privacy will increase over time and drive up the price of the xmr itself.\n\n\#what is the supply of monero (xmr)?\n\nmonero (xmr) currently has a circulating supply of 18,004,702 xmr. it will reach a total supply of 18.4 million xmr by may 2022. there is no max supply in the monero blockchain and it will continue to produce 0.6 xmr per block infinitely to incentivize the miners.\n\n\#conclusion\n\nwhile bitcoin will always pioneers the crypto industry as being the first digital currency ever created. monero differentiates itself from other cryptos by being the most private and achieved financial anonymity. although there are a few other privacy coins available on the market, monero is able to differentiate itself by features such as stealth addresses and ring signatures, plus the asic resistance, and able to become the biggest privacy coin by market cap.\n\nthe monero (xmr) success is also driven by the fact that the community itself is driven more by ideals of complete anonymity should be a fundamental right rather than pursue of profits.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nhelpful links\n\n[",2,0,0,

I tried to teach my kids a lesson in crypto and failed,"Sorry if this isn't allowed, but a true story that has created a dilemma for me follows.\n\nSo my kids are under 10, but they like to learn about everything, especially if their dad is doing it so  a few days ago I decided to teach them what I know about crypto (so not much). This is with the thought that in the bear run I will be buying them all Â£100 of crypto each that they're not allowed until they're 18. I will be giving them a list of coins they are allowed and then they look into them and choose and whatever it is when they're 18 they'll receive in full. \n\nAll sounded like a good idea until we were going through why I was giving them a list of coins and started showing them shit coins and how you can call a coin anything and the name of it doesn't mean anything, so don't judge on that. That made us come across POOCOIN. I wasn't aware of this coin or it's utilities on the bsc so to prove a point I went blind in with Â£5 to show them how quickly it gets to Â£0. \n\nImagine my horror as the further I have been personally dipping into BSC (I've been obsessed), that I was using poo coin website a lot. Imagine my shock walking up this morning and the Â£5 is now Â£40. This is not a shill for poocoin. I still don't know it's tokenomics or why it's actually needed as a coin alongside it's charts, I don't even know how many coins there are or its market cap. \n\nI spoke to my wife this morning and we've agreed that we hope it will sharply decline before my kids ask to see where it has got to, while I'm secretly wishing I'd put my whole portfolio into the joke, because 8x is 8x. It's looking like it might dip though now so I may be saved.\n\nI know this sounds like a hidden shill and ridiculous, but seriously, think how I feel. On one hand is a nice little profit, on the other hand I've taught my kids the worst lesson.\n\nTLDR: tried to teach my kids about shit coins by buying a literal POOCOIN which has since performed better than my whole portfolio since.","i tried to teach my kids a lesson in crypto and failed sorry if this isn't allowed, but a true story that has created a dilemma for me follows.\n\nso my kids are under 10, but they like to learn about everything, especially if their dad is doing it so a few days ago i decided to teach them what i know about crypto (so not much). this is with the thought that in the bear run i will be buying them all Â£100 of crypto each that they're not allowed until they're 18. i will be giving them a list of coins they are allowed and then they look into them and choose and whatever it is when they're 18 they'll receive in full. \n\nall sounded like a good idea until we were going through why i was giving them a list of coins and started showing them shit coins and how you can call a coin anything and the name of it doesn't mean anything, so don't judge on that. that made us come across poocoin. i wasn't aware of this coin or it is utilities on the bsc so to prove a point i went blind in with Â£5 to show them how quickly it gets to Â£0. \n\nimagine my horror as the further i have been personally dipping into bsc (i've been obsessed), that i was using poo coin website a lot. imagine my shock walking up this morning and the Â£5 is now Â£40. this is not a shill for poocoin. i still don't know it is tokenomics or why it is actually needed as a coin alongside it is charts, i don't even know how many coins there are or its market cap. \n\ni spoke to my wife this morning and we've agreed that we hope it will sharply decline before my kids ask to see where it has got to, while i'm secretly wishing i'd put my whole portfolio into the joke, because 8x is 8x. it is looking like it might dip though now so i may be saved.\n\ni know this sounds like a hidden shill and ridiculous, but seriously, think how i feel. on one hand is a nice little profit, on the other hand i've taught my kids the worst lesson.\n\ntldr: tried to teach my kids about shit coins by buying a literal poocoin which has since performed better than my whole portfolio since.",2,0,0,
"A Newbie Navigating Wallets, Exchanges, and Conversions: A Series of Unfortunate Events","I made a series of uninformed decisions that I thought I someone should know about. I'm mostly posting this as a warning to other newbies, but maybe someone could teach me something.\n\nInspired by the sudden explosion in investing early this year, I began my journey into buying crypto. I was smart enough to avoid using Robinhood, but otherwise I was just bright eyed and bushy tailed entering a world I didn't know very well. I started with a few small purchases on Coinbase. I bought some small amounts of BTC, some ETH, and some XLM based on very light research. I even bought like 5 XTZ at some point after being impressed by their mission.\n\nAt some point it seemed like the general consensus was to put those in a wallet to keep them safe. ""Not your keys, not your coins,"" right? **This might have been my first mistake.** I used the Coinbase wallet and quickly learned about the fees for transferring. My $100 ETH turned in $70 just that quickly. And if I want to put it back on the exchange? I'd be lucky to end up with $50 in ETH.\n\nTransferring XLM was much less expensive. After learning about the cheaper fees on Coinbase Pro, I decided I would pull the XLM out of my wallet and put it on Coinbase Pro to play around with. **This was my second mistake.** To transfer XLM, you need to include a memo. Forgetting the memo, my XLM completed the transfer, but it sure as hell wasn't on my Coinbase Pro account. After contacting Coinbase Pro, they quickly told me to transfer an exact amount of XLM from the wallet back to the Coinbase Pro exchange in order to confirm my transaction and get my original XLM back. I bought a little bit more XLM, attempted the transfer with that exact amount (and a memo this time) only to have this XLM disappear as well. It has been almost a month, and Coinbase Support still has not responded to my repeated inquiries.\n\nFeeling both stupid and cheated, I decided to go elsewhere for crypto. I made my way over to Kraken and deposited my small amount of XTZ. After the Filecoin double deposit debacle, I thought I'd take a chance converting my XTZ to Siacoin. I'm happy with that decision, but Kraken is not as user friendly as Coinbase. **This was my third mistake.** I didn't research Kraken as well, and it appears I cannot link it directly to my bank account. Neither Coinbase nor Binance.us support SIA, so the only way I can think to get it out is convert it (fees), transfer it (fees), then sell it (fees). I'm not even sure if I have enough to even cover that amount.\n\nNow I technically own a diverse portfolio, but the amounts are so small I can't really do anything with it. I have an amount of ETH that I can't realistically move from one wallet, some XLM that disappeared into nothingness, some SIA that might as well be imaginary, and hell, I even purchased a small amount of BNB on Binance. It might all total an amount that would cover a month of rent, but at this point it's so spread out that I can't realistically recover that much from it.\n\nI'm not too upset, and this has all been a learning experience, but I hope others can learn from my mistakes. If you're planning to buy a good amount and hold long term, just stuff it in a wallet and forget it. And if you want to trade it back and forth and sell it quickly, and exchange is great. But please, just don't do what I did and put small amounts of different coins on different exchanges and in different wallets. And for the love of god, do a little research first.","a newbie navigating wallets, exchanges, and conversions: a series of unfortunate events i made a series of uninformed decisions that i thought i someone should know about. i'm mostly posting this as a warning to other newbies, but maybe someone could teach me something.\n\ninspired by the sudden explosion in investing early this year, i began my journey into buying crypto. i was smart enough to avoid using robinhood, but otherwise i was just bright eyed and bushy tailed entering a world i didn't know very well. i started with a few small purchases on coinbase. i bought some small amounts of btc, some eth, and some xlm based on very light research. i even bought like 5 xtz at some point after being impressed by their mission.\n\nat some point it seemed like the general consensus was to put those in a wallet to keep them safe.

Why I take profits for mental Health,"First of all, there?s nothing wrong with being here for the long run and DCAing or just buying the dips, Kudos to all you Diamond hands for being so strong!\n\nHowever, after putting way too much of my money in crypto, it nearly ruined my mental Health, when it crashed in may and I had nothing to buy all the dips, that kept dipping. To not having to endure such situations again, I now have a strict Plan for Bullruns, that might not bring me the most gains, but let me sleep so much better:\n\nWhenever we have the signals for a strong Market like in Oct./Nov. or Single  Coins reach ATHs, I start DCAing out for the next couple of weeks. \n\nAm I able to time the market? Of course not! But for the strong volatility of the moment and the uncertainity of the future market, I really enjoy having\n\n1. safe gains, no matter how the Market Performs after that\n2. money to buy the dip, if the Market dips after selling, which it most of the time does sometime after reaching ATHs\n3. the possibility to focus on and research new projects after realising my gains.\n4. a good sleep, no matter how the Market moves (up, I sell more of my coins/ down, I finally have more FIAT to buy the dips).\n\nMaybe this post was pretty pointless, because ofc most People try to buy low and sell high.

Optimizing 2022 (and beyond) crypto coin allocation,"Medium-term lurker, first time poster here. So I paid off my student loans at the start of this year, and since have gotten really interested in crypto. Despite clear guidance here and repeated admonishments from my wife, I left lots of money on the table this year through dumb day trading. [Face palm](https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/captain-picard-facepalm-bust/intro-import.webp). It turns out that DCA and HODL ***truly*** is the time-honored advice for a reason . . .\n\nSo here I am at the start of 2022, looking to firmly HODL my portfolio for at least the next 3-5 years and/or until it hits a particular long-term price. My current portfolio allocation, projected 2022 buying allocation (and the resulting net allocation), long-term price goal (and corresponding multiplier against today's prices) are all below. \n\nI am teeming with questions for those with a lot more experience:\n\n1. *2022 allocation among coins*: what do folks think about the proposed allocation among coins for 2022? Many are informed by cool projects I first discovered here. For price volatility and risk balancing concerns, I go back and forth on whether I should allocate more to ETH (like 40-45%), maybe by scaling back my DOT (as a total investor newbie, I got suckered into buying more in November as the price plummeted). Do folks think that's too much in relatively unproven projects like ATOM, ONE, and CKB? Need any re-balancing? Any glaring omissions? \n\n2. *2022 allocation among coin types*: another question wracking my brain is how to allocate among types of crypto projects. I don't game, so I feel wholly inadequate at judging coins like Centraland or Metaverse. I'm mostly interested in smart contract applications (I guess that comes with being a lawyer!), but do folks think that leaves me topically unbalanced? Also, is it worth throwing like 5-10% of my portfolio into shitcoins?\n\n3.  *Long-term sale point*: The final column lists the multiplier I want to HODL until before gradually selling. The first four seem reasonably likely on a long enough time frame. Is hopium unrealistically fueling the final four projections? Any adjustments you'd make? \n\n| Coin  | Current portfolio    | 2022 allocation    | Net EOY 2022 | Hopeful long-term Price | Multiplier\n|:-----------|------------:|:------------:|:------------:| :------------:| :------------:\n| *ETH*      | 4.1% | 30% | 17.18% | $8,000 | 2.14x\n| *ADA*      | 9.8% | 5% | 7.4% | $5 | 3.7x\n| *DOT*     | 43.8% | 15% | 29.3% | $150 | 5.3x\n| *SOL*      | 27.3% | 10% | 18.6% | $800| 4.6x\n| *ATOM*      | 4.1% | 15% | 9.6% | $350| 11.6x\n| *ONE*      | 5.2% | 15% | 10.12% | $3| 13.0x\n| *CKB*    | 3.1% | 10% | 6.58% | $0.3| 13.3x\n| *ALGO*      | 2.6% | 0% | 1.28% | $10| 5.8x","optimizing 2022 (and beyond) crypto coin allocation medium-term lurker, first time poster here. so i paid off my student loans at the start of this year, and since have gotten really interested in crypto. despite clear guidance here and repeated admonishments from my wife, i left lots of money on the table this year through dumb day trading.

"Bitcoin vs Bitcoin Cash, and why BCH is better in every single way","I see a lot of hate towards BCH which in my opinion is completely unjustified. Before I get into why BCH is good let me break down some common arguments against Bitcoin Block size being atleast 7mb.\n\n1. Bitcoin is digital gold/ Store of value - No, no it isn't. Bitcoin was intended to replace fiat, and act as a new form of money. It was meant to allow people to buy things safely, securely, and without censorship. If you disagree, allow me to introduce you to the title of the whitepages -   [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)\n2. This will lead to more centralization - This is kind of true, in the argument that this reduces miners because of lower fees, however I will argue time and time again, ASIC mining is where you start if you really want to argue with centralization of mining, not block size, as block size provides much more benefit to the network.\n3. Larger blockchain, more centralization - Storage has increased greatly in the past couple of years lessening the truth of this, and a bigger blockchain is necessary for Bitcoin to be a currency, so this is an unavoidable drawback, but one that should just be accepted.\n\nI invested in Crypto and joined the space out of principle, a decentralized finance system sounds better for all to me. Modern Day Bitcoin is nothing but a shitcoin in my opinion because of its lackluster tech, inefficient network, among other things. Lightning and Segwit both help lighten the damage of this 1MB block size but it doesn't scale forever and each of those are considered trying to optimize around a core issue. This approach was supported by early proponent Roger Ver and its why Bitcoin cash is much better than Bitcoin is. \n\nI've also heard people say use Nano for day to day and Bitcoin for long term value store, but here is my question. If Bitcoin is a value store that can't buy anything why should people value it? Storing money in NANO is better long term in that situation because atleast NANO is useful while Bitcoin is not. \n\nBitcoin is not scalable and nothing near a revolution, its a bloated corpse that was failed to be update and paralyzed by an Anarchical maintenance. It goes against everything Crypto is, and in my opinion is  far more overrated when compared against ETH, BCH, NANO, or other currencies which provide more to the table than it does.","bitcoin vs bitcoin cash, and why bch is better in every single way i see a lot of hate towards bch which in my opinion is completely unjustified. before i get into why bch is good let me break down some common arguments against bitcoin block size being atleast 7mb.\n\n1. bitcoin is digital gold/ store of value - no, no it isn't. bitcoin was intended to replace fiat, and act as a new form of money. it was meant to allow people to buy things safely, securely, and without censorship. if you disagree, allow me to introduce you to the title of the whitepages - [bitcoin: a peer-to-peer electronic cash system]( this will lead to more centralization - this is kind of true, in the argument that this reduces miners because of lower fees, however i will argue time and time again, asic mining is where you start if you really want to argue with centralization of mining, not block size, as block size provides much more benefit to the network.\n3. larger blockchain, more centralization - storage has increased greatly in the past couple of years lessening the truth of this, and a bigger blockchain is necessary for bitcoin to be a currency, so this is an unavoidable drawback, but one that should just be accepted.\n\ni invested in crypto and joined the space out of principle, a decentralized finance system sounds better for all to me. modern day bitcoin is nothing but a shitcoin in my opinion because of its lackluster tech, inefficient network, among other things. lightning and segwit both help lighten the damage of this 1mb block size but it doesn't scale forever and each of those are considered trying to optimize around a core issue. this approach was supported by early proponent roger ver and its why bitcoin cash is much better than bitcoin is. \n\ni've also heard people say use nano for day to day and bitcoin for long term value store, but here is my question. if bitcoin is a value store that can't buy anything why should people value it? storing money in nano is better long term in that situation because atleast nano is useful while bitcoin is not. \n\nbitcoin is not scalable and nothing near a revolution, its a bloated corpse that was failed to be update and paralyzed by an anarchical maintenance. it goes against everything crypto is, and in my opinion is far more overrated when compared against eth, bch, nano, or other currencies which provide more to the table than it does.",2,0,0,

"Personal opinion: focus in long term right now, forget the short term","Letâ€™s get it out of the way first, this is not financial advice, this is just my personal opinion for what I think could be very helpful to people in the crypto community right now.\n\nI donâ€™t think itâ€™s a stretch to say many people got into cryptos in the last year, especially those that came in around the time that the last major bull run happened at the end of 2020. It feels like many people with less than two years on their crypto belt have this idea of cryptos that they bounce up and down continually. \n\nYes buying the dip is a fun concept, but in times like these, the bottom could very well be a ways from today. If I had to go down on paper my guess would be weâ€™ll hit $25,000 before we go into another bull run. But that isnâ€™t the point, because thatâ€™s obviously just a guess. The point is donâ€™t put all your eggs in one basket just because the market dropped, set yourself up for a long term DCA plan would be my suggestion. My plan will be to buy on a weekly basis for the next few months.\n\nAnother thing I want to say though is that I donâ€™t have a negative outlook on cryptos just because I think weâ€™re headed downhill for a while. Iâ€™m still extremely confident cryptos are the future, and the tech is exactly what our world either needs or will need. I think in 10 years every invest I make now will be worth far more then.

post a coin and we roast it,Hey guys it's been a rough few months in crypto so I figured we could lighten things up with a fun game. So post a coin you are bullish on and we will roast you for it or roast the coin itself.

Should we start talking about fees again?,"Since we are in a bull market there is a big positive vibe going through all crypto subs, which is understandable.

BIP TBD ï¿½ CODENAME: FOXTROT UNIFORM CHARLIE KILO ELON - A new method for energy saving with bitcoin mining,"**Abstract**\n\nTo reduce energy consumption a new mining method is proposed which will cause substantial idle time to occur during the mining time for each block, resulting in up to 99% in energy savings. The changes only require new hash input\n\n**Motivation**\n\nTo save energy because, you know, Elon\n\n**Proposal**\n\nIn addition, the existing block hash, a tweet will be added from twitter as random text to the hash input strings.

How is Crypto Beneficial for the Real Estate Industry?," I have many years of experience when it comes to dealing with real estate and some in crypto. The whole idea behind combining these two seems odd at first but it is actually great. The blockchain industry has in a way completely reshaped the world of real estate. As more and more people have started moving towards this method of buying and selling real estate, it has opened doors to many new possibilities that were not provided by the traditional method. People who are new to this don?t feel too comfortable about investing in anything as such but once they do, they realize that it is indeed a better way of buying or selling property.\n\nSome of the many benefits of merging crypto with real estate are:\n\n?  Real estate assets can be tokenized and make the whole process very simple than the traditional method.\n\n?  Buyers and sellers have a new way of connecting with each other and all the process is completely transparent.\n\n?  Intermediaries are no longer there so the buying price becomes reasonable enough.\n\n?  Tokenizing a property is safer than acquiring it by the traditional method.\n\n?  Fractional ownership is easy and possible to be formed over a platform so you are not required to meet physically with one another.\n\n?  Secondary market opportunities open up to a great extent.\n\nCan you think of some more? The benefits are many but the most important thing to keep in mind is not to hesitate in learning and explore something new.\n\nProjects such as RealBlocks, LandShare, and more are continuously working towards bringing real estate to the blockchain. These platforms offer a hassle-free way of acquiring real estate as compared to the age-old method.\n\nWhat do you think the future of the real estate and blockchain together holds? Will it be able to get real traction or not?","how is crypto beneficial for the real estate industry? i have many years of experience when it comes to dealing with real estate and some in crypto. the whole idea behind combining these two seems odd at first but it is actually great. the blockchain industry has in a way completely reshaped the world of real estate. as more and more people have started moving towards this method of buying and selling real estate, it has opened doors to many new possibilities that were not provided by the traditional method. people who are new to this dont feel too comfortable about investing in anything as such but once they do, they realize that it is indeed a better way of buying or selling property.\n\nsome of the many benefits of merging crypto with real estate are:\n\n real estate assets can be tokenized and make the whole process very simple than the traditional method.\n\n buyers and sellers have a new way of connecting with each other and all the process is completely transparent.\n\n intermediaries are no longer there so the buying price becomes reasonable enough.\n\n tokenizing a property is safer than acquiring it by the traditional method.\n\n fractional ownership is easy and possible to be formed over a platform so you are not required to meet physically with one another.\n\n secondary market opportunities open up to a great extent.\n\ncan you think of some more? the benefits are many but the most important thing to keep in mind is not to hesitate in learning and explore something new.\n\nprojects such as realblocks, landshare, and more are continuously working towards bringing real estate to the blockchain. these platforms offer a hassle-free way of acquiring real estate as compared to the age-old method.\n\nwhat do you think the future of the real estate and blockchain together holds? will it be able to get real traction or not?",2,0,0,

Crypto Hacks for Experts and Long Term Hodlers,"There is a lot of advice for beginners that are new to crypto, but what about advice for long term holders?\n\nHere my five hacks:\n\n1. Dont HODL forever. Take at least your initial investment out and keep it in Fiat and wait for the next dip or crash.\n2. Dont use stablecoins for too long. If you are waiting for a dip or bear market, dont leave a huge amount of money in stablecoins, especiallys USDT. You never know what happens during a big crash and if your stablecoin is safe or wont crash too. If you dont daytrade and you are waiting for a good entry point, just change the money back to fiat - and transfer it to your bank account, dont leave it on an exchange.\n3. Dont get lazy with security. At least two or three times a year open you Nano ledger or whatever you use, just see how and if it works, check where your seed phrase is stored. Reconsider if its the best way to store it. If you got a lot of money on it, you might wanna store it in a safe, perhaps even in a bank safe. Also: Did you brag about your crypto gains? Who knows where your seed phrase is? Your wife? Is she still your wife, or your ex who wants money? Do your friends know, or could they know? Just print a new seed phrase and store it somewhere else from year to year.\n4. Dont miss new opportunities. We all have our favourite coins and perhaps you bought them years ago and just watch them growing, but dont be lazy to do research and search for new opportunities. You dont have to like NFTs or the Web3 or PlayToEarn Games, but if you think some project is legit, invest in it. You dont have to love what earns you money.\n5. Dont forget your real life out there. Do you want to buy a flat, a house, quit your job, then fucking sell your cryptos and finally live your dream.

Some questions from a first year noob,"I first bought some crypto back in 2017 but got more heavily into it Jan 2021. I?ve been searching for answers to a couple questions but can?t find them and I?m hoping you guys can help me out. Hopefully others may have the same questions can also learn.\n\n1. Why do people suggest using a specific coin like usdc, trx, xlm or whatever  for transferring money between exchanges? Doesn?t the conversion of your target crypto cause a taxable event? The biggest reason I?ve read is due to speed and cost, but I can usually wait 10 mins no problem and most cryptos are not that expensive to transfer.\n2. Are there any serious trusted voices out there (like a chamath, naval, vitalik someone) who puts out legitimate crypto investing articles/blogs/podcasts? I?ve yet to find a reliable source discussing the investing pros and cons of individual altcoins. Where are people actually DYOR?\n3. In my experiences with stock trading, determining capital gains is usually pretty straight forward. The problem with crypto is the transaction fees are usually paid in crypto, not USD.  The result after moving something to a wallet and back is that I have less ?shares? to sell than I bought. How the heck are we supposed account for this? \n4. Sometimes a CEX or cold wallet will not transfer the full amount of crypto that I  have down to the 6th decimal place or whatever, even if I select Max. I think this is usually due to changing transaction fees, but also some coins or exchanges seem to only handle 0 or 1 decimal place. What am I supposed to do with .026326 of a coin that?s worth $0.10?

Then I decide to transfer it to a stable coin because I think the market might crash and I will get back in at a lower price and gain more Bitcoin.\n\nWould I have to show the $1000 increase or could I continue to hold it off until I decide to cash out and deposit it back into my bank. \n\nAlso what are some good strategies to not lose a good chunk to taxes. Is there any type of investment I can make like in property that would help me not lose a lot in taxes?","taxes on gains. so i'm fairly new the the crypto community and was wondering what i would have to show in my taxes every year.\n\ni understand that any money i transfer from crypto back to fiat i will have to show my gains when i fill my taxes.\n\nbut,\n\ndo i have to show every transaction, for instance i invested $1000 in bitcoin and it increased in value to $2000. then i decide to transfer it to a stable coin because i think the market might crash and i will get back in at a lower price and gain more bitcoin.\n\nwould i have to show the $1000 increase or could i continue to hold it off until i decide to cash out and deposit it back into my bank. \n\nalso what are some good strategies to not lose a good chunk to taxes. is there any type of investment i can make like in property that would help me not lose a lot in taxes?",2,0,1,

Buying crypto has got to be made easier if we ever want this to be mainstream.,"Allow me to tell you a story. Over the past few days, I've been hearing a lot about NANO. I've done some research and decided that I want to buy some to see where it goes. If it does well enough, I might even start using it to process payments for my business.\n\nHow do you buy Nano? I ask myself. Like most beginners in Crypto, I only use a couple tools- a wallet, Coinbase, and Binance. Nano isn't even available on Coinbase, so that's out of the question. How bout Binance? It's there, but I can't log into my account- I get 403 errors. Odd, but okay.\n\nHow else could I buy it? I do a Google search and check Nano's own website. Wirex? Can't, I'm American. Coingate? American. MoonPay? American. Simplex? American. Swapzone? I think that would work, but I would need to already have crypto, pay a fee to deposit it, then pay another fee to exchange it, then pay a third fee to put it in my wallet. Kraken? Maybe Kraken. I uploaded my documents and am now waiting for permission to buy Tether, which I can exchange for Nano.\n\nEvery step along the way I've had to create an account, verify my email, upload ID paperwork (!!), and then be denied. It has taken about two hours, I've exposed myself to a huge amount of ID theft, and I am feeling very frustrated. **There is no way people will use crypto as a currency if it remains this difficult to acquire.** We have got to make this easier and more transparent.","buying crypto has got to be made easier if we ever want this to be mainstream. allow me to tell you a story. over the past few days, i've been hearing a lot about nano. i've done some research and decided that i want to buy some to see where it goes. if it does well enough, i might even start using it to process payments for my business.\n\nhow do you buy nano? i ask myself. like most beginners in crypto, i only use a couple tools- a wallet, coinbase, and binance. nano isn't even available on coinbase, so that is out of the question. how bout binance? it is there, but i can't log into my account- i get 403 errors. odd, but okay.\n\nhow else could i buy it? i do a google search and check nano is own website. wirex? can't, i'm american. coingate? american. moonpay? american. simplex? american. swapzone? i think that would work, but i would need to already have crypto, pay a fee to deposit it, then pay another fee to exchange it, then pay a third fee to put it in my wallet. kraken? maybe kraken. i uploaded my documents and am now waiting for permission to buy tether, which i can exchange for nano.\n\nevery step along the way i've had to create an account, verify my email, upload id paperwork (!!), and then be denied. it has taken about two hours, i've exposed myself to a huge amount of id theft, and i am feeling very frustrated. **there is no way people will use crypto as a currency if it remains this difficult to acquire.** we have got to make this easier and more transparent.",2,0,1,

Long term earning strategy,"So, what are your long term strategies in the crypto market?\n\nI am holding BTC since 2014 and ETH since 2017.

How did you get into crypto?,"Hey there! I only got into crypto this year after hearing for the (what felt like thousands time) how Bitcoin has again hit a new all time high. 2016 I had already kicked myself for not getting into crypto earlier and I thought it was too late. Now, five years later I had the same ""now it's too late"" thought but this time I thought fuck it. Better joining in ""too late"" than running the risk of having another of these moments a few years down the line. I bought some Doge, took some profits and then started investing in other crypto currencies. Told myself I'm only going to invest one monthly salary into all of this and now am way past this.

REEF - Is it a scam or is it here to stay?," \n\nHey guys,\n\nI'm relatively new to crypto and wanted to know what this sub thinks of REEF?\n\nWhen I first stumbled upon the project I thought it sounded promising; an ""all in one platform"" to make DeFi a more user friendly experience.\n\nHowever, I have read a few posts in this sub about the operation being a potential scam? The posts are from a couple months ago and relate specifically to the .5 billion tokens being added to the supply without warning. The posts also claim there were a lot of shill accounts for this coin who were ridiculing people who were asking questions about this issue in the telegram chat.\n\nThe founder (Denko) has tried to clear up this issue, saying the tokens were added in order to combat market manipulation via bots?\n\nLastly, I also found out about a website (thanks to this sub!) called [tokensniffer.com](https://tokensniffer.com/). For those who don't know, this site allows you to check the similarity in the code between different coins and even alerts you to when the code has been copied from a 'scam coin'. I decided to check REEF out and I found it has over 88% similarity with three different projects that have all been outed as scams.\n\n[https://tokensniffer.com/token/0xfe3e6a25e6b192a42a44ecddcd13796471735acf](https://tokensniffer.com/token/0xfe3e6a25e6b192a42a44ecddcd13796471735acf)\n\nObviously REEF finance is about more than just the REEF token, however, it still seems lazy to copy so much of the code? and from scam projects?

Suppose a non-profit organization wants to receive crypto as a donation, or in lieu of fiat for something it already takes in money for (e.g. membership dues).\n\nHere are some of the mysteries to me:\n\nWhat kind of platform can facilitate this?  Or can/should the org simply generate a paper wallet to take incoming money (and then update the paper wallet address whenever they want to move the funds or sell them...)?\n\nWhat sort of regulatory reporting, etc. will the org need to do while holding the crypto?

Your idea has already been done and you need to invest in xyz coin today fool so they can implement it quick!""

It's all hypothetical and for fun:\n\n**Crypto Limbo**\n*Problem*: Holy shit I just lost 1 ETH because I sent it  to the wrong address. It's gone.

You have a malicious virus on your device that changes your pasted addresses to a hacker's address.\n\n*Solution?:* 2 authys and a happy ending.\n\n Our hypothetical coin will be called Confirmation Exchange Token (CET). Before any transaction made on the blockchain exchanges is finalized you receive a deposit of a single CET token that has a contract to authenticate and verify a successful target address. \n\n*Example*: Let's say you want to send 1 ETH to pay for new tires on your Lambo. You send it to your exchange account on Kraken. Before you receive the ETH, you get a notification from Kraken that one CET coin has deposited. By design and some magic Dev engineering, it triggers an authentication request on the Kraken exchange for your Authy app code (or any other authenticator like Google Auth, etc). After you type in your Authy code for Kraken,  you then go back to your original account which  prompts it's own authentication request, this completes the send, and your Ethereum is now in it's correct and verified new home. \n\n*Failsafe*: This process requires 2 authentications. If it was not sent to the right address, both Authy codes never prompt you  from either account and the transaction times out and does not process.  \n\nHere's another one....................................\n\n**Not your Keys**\n*Problem*:  I want to have the benefit of using an Exchange 24/7, being able to trade, swap, sell, buy, future, short, watch it dip and rise in real-time, etc AND own the keys to each and every individual coin right up until I sell them. \n\n*Solution*?: Contracts with ownership. The keys to your coins are tied to a contract that transfers ownership with every transaction that trades hands (sells, swap, etc). \n\nWatchya think?

Cryptocurrency adoption is slowed by the inability to test its capabilities through a demo mode.,"Hey everyone!

Unfortunately, there was no Testnet option or some kind of demo mode, as I had thought there would be. Obviously, in a situation such as this, you can use real cryptos and pay some fees, but I lack the resources to do so.?\n\nCould it be that no one considers mass adoption through experimenting with interfaces via demo mode?

Question about Proof of Stake,"Hi, this might've been asked before, but I'm hoping somebody here can answer to my specific problem with PoS.\n\nMy problem understanding PoS isn't about the staking aspect, but how a transaction is validated in  a PoS mechanism.\n\nIn Proof of Work it is by solving for a hash function to create the next block of the blockchain, where more computing power gives you a higher chance of finding it (basically correct, right?).\n\nSo in Proof of Stake I understand that by staking the token of the blockchain, you can be selected to validate the next of block of the blockchain.

Would a trustless raffle be possible using cryptocurrency?,"Hi. My friends have been raffling objects they made and donating the pooled money to charity. The way it works is people send them USD using venmo or paypal and then whoever set up the raffle donates that money that is being pooled to a charity. The issue is that to donate you have to trust that they won't pocket the money. This trust system limits who are comfortable participating in the raffle, in a sense the raffle can't expand beyond a close network of known people. Would there be a way to set up a crypto wallet that people can send crypto to that can be audited by everyone? It would also be interesting if the wallet would automatically send the money to charity at a set date. In essence, a system that is programmed to pool the money, securely and transparently, and then send it to a charity without needing human input. \n\nThe potential resistance to using cryptocurrency for this is that I suspect most people participating in the raffles do not have much crypto experience. There are also transaction fees to consider as well as the issue of potentially having to convert the crypto to USD before donating it.

What Makes Digital Real Estate Valuable?,,What Makes Digital Real Estate Valuable?,2,0,1,
"You can limit risk by using ""risky"" futures trading (without leverage)","Disclaimer:  this is not meant as general advice, this is a strategy I'm sharing  which may appeal to some people. If you don't trust a centralized  exchange (like Binance) with your funds, please ignore this post.\n\nContrary to  common belief, buy-and-hold is not the ""least risky"" way to invest. You  can have tighter control over downside-risk by trading Futures.\n\nFutures  trading offers leverage up to 100x, which is why it's considered  extremely risky. However, you can lower the leverage all the way down to  1x (no leverage), while enjoying features that are unique to the  Futures platform.\n\nI'm talking  about the ability to set a stop-loss. It's very intuitive, you just  enter the price you want your position to be sold at (you can change  this price afterwards, and you'll be shown how many $ you lose if your  position is sold at a given price).\n\n\-------\n\nExample of how you can stay in the game without being exposed to a huge market correction:\n\nYou  have $1000. You want to invest in BTC or DOT or whatever.  When you buy your desired coin, you set the stop-loss at a  price 20% below the current price.

Why Bitcoin might fall?,"\n\nI've recently really got into crypto. However, there are some concerns about Bitcoin that I have that I cant knock back.?\n\n\nFirstly, I noticed that many believe that Bitcoin could replace our financial system. My issue with this is that wouldn't there be issues in the allocation of money to people? with no central governance how would governments supply those who require benefits? How could they supply funds to new businesses or gov backed developments? wouldn't wealth stay firmly stuck with the few - a problem that admittedly still exists with normal money, but surely the problem is accentuated by Bitcoin?\n\n\nSecondly, I've seen many arguments about the intrinsic value of bitcoin. Realistically, from my understanding the tech for bitcoin is clunky compared to other cryptos, the limit of 7 transactions a second will surely hinder its use as a global currency? Furthermore, as a store of wealth is it that favourable? Gold for example is scarce and has real world use, electronics and fashion. Unfortunately you can't wear a bitcoin.\n\n\nI do actually believe cryptos can be a store of wealth, but fundamentally they also need to have real utility so they have something to fall back onto. With Bitcoin, surely the only incentive to own bitcoin at the moment is so you can sell it on to somebody else for the same amount or more money??\n\nWouldn't a coin like Erg be a better store of value? It has real utility and is scarce and can be redistributed if not moved about after a certain time period ( preventing money being lost ). And yes lol, kind of a shameless plug bc I've invested in Erg. But I'm more interested in what people think about my questions and if I'm correct in thinking that something LIKE Erg is actually a better store of wealth.\n\n?","why bitcoin might fall? \n\ni've recently really got into crypto. however, there are some concerns about bitcoin that i have that i cant knock back.\n\n\nfirstly, i noticed that many believe that bitcoin could replace our financial system. my issue with this is that wouldn't there be issues in the allocation of money to people? with no central governance how would governments supply those who require benefits? how could they supply funds to new businesses or gov backed developments? wouldn't wealth stay firmly stuck with the few - a problem that admittedly still exists with normal money, but surely the problem is accentuated by bitcoin?\n\n\nsecondly, i've seen many arguments about the intrinsic value of bitcoin. realistically, from my understanding the tech for bitcoin is clunky compared to other cryptos, the limit of 7 transactions a second will surely hinder its use as a global currency? furthermore, as a store of wealth is it that favourable? gold for example is scarce and has real world use, electronics and fashion. unfortunately you can't wear a bitcoin.\n\n\ni do actually believe cryptos can be a store of wealth, but fundamentally they also need to have real utility so they have something to fall back onto. with bitcoin, surely the only incentive to own bitcoin at the moment is so you can sell it on to somebody else for the same amount or more money?\n\nwouldn't a coin like erg be a better store of value? it has real utility and is scarce and can be redistributed if not moved about after a certain time period ( preventing money being lost ). and yes lol, kind of a shameless plug bc i've invested in erg. but i'm more interested in what people think about my questions and if i'm correct in thinking that something like erg is actually a better store of wealth.\n\n",2,0,1,

DAI over USDT for day-to-day trades?,"Hi all.\n\nI am a New Yorker and as such have a lot of restrictions on buying and selling and the services that I can use. I'm only using Coinbase because it is 1 of 2 services allowed here and is the easier of them to use. They also allow trading immediately after purchase, while you wait (and wait, and wait) for the USD to clear to the account, which takes 5-10 business days.\n\nThe USD to crypto wait is very impractical and not useful at all for any trading that might take place more quickly. I was considering stocking up on Tether to use as the primary trading currency but am considering DAI now. It is currently yielding 2% annually on Coinbase, which is cool but I'm not super concerned with that, it more importantly is owned by one major owner, runs on the Ethereum platform, and has ETH as collateral. USDT's collateral is all fiat, which concerns me for a looming collapse of USD.\n\nIs DAI a better option for regular trading due to the above factors (and any others) or is it best to stay inside stablecoin safety zone with Tether.

What Crypto should I invest in? Total noob needing advice,"Hi everyone!\n\nSo I recently got a new job, and I want to invest into some crypto to hopefully make some extra money! \n\nI am wondering what do you guys recommend? I want to put about $750 or so every two weeks into savings. Of that, I would like to invest maybe $200-$250, so about $500 a month. \n\nNow the question begs, what do I invest in? I know bitcoin and eth are good, but I want something where I have the chance to make more profit. I know everyone wants to hit the next ?bitcoin? or ?etherum?. Is there any coin that looks worthwhile to invest in that might have large gains? Or should I just invest all my money into bitcoin and try and make slow passive income? Would it be worth putting a decent amount into ADA and hope it shoots up at some point again(I seen it was at about 2.60) and hold and ?stake? it (not really sure what stake means lol). Would avalanche or terra be worth investing in with my ?small-ish? amount? They seem to be growing quite a lot. Would solana be worth investing in for good returns in say 6 months?\n\nI?m mainly trying to buy a new car so I thought this would be a cool side hustle to make some extra cash. And also crypto interests me and I?ve wanted to invest for AWHILE.

Why is centralization such a bad thing?,"From my understanding these are some of the arguments against it:\n\n* If mining becomes centralized, they can control the blockchain.\n   * Well, they still have to adhere to the protocol. So any invalid transactions or signatures will be rejected. Worst case, a hard fork will be needed.\n   * They have no incentive to do anything malicious since it will just hurt them.\n* Few will control all the coin\n   * Yes, they will get all the rewards, but I guess it's fair if they have the proof of work. If others want to also get the rewards, they can increase their hash power and decentralize to whatever extent is required (sort of a balance).\n   * Everyone can just buy coins from the central authority. If they don't sell or try to burn them, it will just increase the value of the remaining coins and hurt them in the process.\n\nOverall, it seems like centralization isn't catastrophic since it doesn't actually hurt people using the currency.

Isn't cross-chain compatibility the future?

What is the difference between swap and exchange crypto?," The mechanics of swapping and trading crypto on exchanges are the same, but the difference in outcome is significant.\n\n**SWAP**\n\nSwap is a crypto-to-crypto exchange. It conveniently converts your crypto assets for their equivalent value in another coin or token to either build a portfolio, cut losses, use crypto as payment, or avoid slippage costs or other high transaction fees.\n\nFor example, if the other user wants to send you $100 in Ethereum (ETH), but you prefer to receive Bitcoin (BTC) to build your portfolio, you can enable the Easy Swap Engine so the app would automatically swap any ETH or any other currency you receive into BTC.\n\nSwapping from your Private Key Wallets benefits non-custodial, on-chain trade settlement. Swapping from your Trading Accounts provides faster settlement and no network fees.\n\n**EXCHANGE**\n\nExchanging crypto, on the other hand, deals with digital trading assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and even tangible assets. It involves buying or selling crypto. You trade one crypto for another crypto or a fiat currency based on their current market price to increase your earnings, whether short- or long-term. Trading pairs are involved in the exchange process, like the BTC/USDT or KASTA/USDT.\n\n**To Sum Up**\n\nNow that we understand how swapping and exchange work, our decision-making becomes more polished. Remember that there are no fixed strategies when it comes to crypto trading. The market is constantly fickle, so the best approach is to keep an open mind and an open eye to opportunities.","What is the difference between swap and exchange crypto?

As I predicted, Bitcoin's price started to rise towards the time of the FED meeting. I'm not a person who uses Stop-Loss a lot, but since everyone I see said 'don't forget to use it', I set a Stop-Loss order at 19.200$ just in case. \n\nAfter the interest rate was announced at the Fed meeting, as you know, within seconds, Bitcoin first went up to 20.000$ and then suddenly started to fall. My stop-Loss order didn't work at 19,200$ and it automatically closed the position at 18.400$, almost the lowest point where Bitcoin fell.\n\nIn this case, I made a loss because of Stop-Loss. If Stop-Loss doesn't work on sudden drops, then why we should use it? If the order had never worked, I would still understand it. However, the fact that it worked at a level far below the Stop-Loss order I gave, that's a huge problem.","why were my coins sold at a lower price than the stop-loss order i entered? hello. this thing happened a month ago, but i wanted to ask anyway. \n\non the morning of september 21, i opened a long trade at $18900 on bitcoin. as i predicted, bitcoin is price started to rise towards the time of the fed meeting. i'm not a person who uses stop-loss a lot, but since everyone i see said 'don't forget to use it', i set a stop-loss order at 19.200$ just in case. \n\nafter the interest rate was announced at the fed meeting, as you know, within seconds, bitcoin first went up to 20.000$ and then suddenly started to fall. my stop-loss order didn't work at 19,200$ and it automatically closed the position at 18.400$, almost the lowest point where bitcoin fell.\n\nin this case, i made a loss because of stop-loss. if stop-loss doesn't work on sudden drops, then why we should use it? if the order had never worked, i would still understand it. however, the fact that it worked at a level far below the stop-loss order i gave, that is a huge problem.",2,0,1,

Is transferring trx to FTX exchange from CoinDCX and then converting to USD to purchase crypto illegal?,"**Premise**\n\nGiven the volatile situation with a lot of exchanges halting withdrawals of cryptos, especially in India, in order to safeguard my investments, I wanted to devise an approach to offload my crypto to a cold wallet.

Once I have purchased the crypto, directly move the crypto to my cold wallet\n\n**Question**\n\nI am keeping a track of each sale and purchase and it's INR value so I can keep aside the 1% TDS to then pay at the end of the year.

Noob has questions about NFT's and OpenSea.,"As the title states I am a noob in the world of crypto and NFT's and I would like help with some questions I have. First of all I have already created a trust wallet and connected it to OpenSea which means I already have an account and a wallet. I have been taking part in some reddit NFT giveaways and have won a couple of pieces. My first question is, if someone gifts me an NFT do I have the right to sell it? If yes, how? I'm asking how because I've already tried more than a dozen times to list an item but it never lists with the price I want, it's always a different price. When I listed an item for the first time it asked me to sign a small transaction and I did but even though my wallet balance was $0 it still was successful. Then it asked to sign a message which also was successful, after that it said that the item was successfully listed to be sold but the price on the item wasn't the one I placed. Now it happens with every item. It doesn't ask me to sign the transaction to list an item again but it always asks for the ""sign message"" which is always successful but the price is never right. Can someone help me with this and maybe some other questions I have? I know this post is all over the place but I've been trying to figure this whole thing out on my own doing my ""DYOR"" too but haven't come up with a definitive answer yet.

Which is better: Buying Top Coins vs. Buying BTC &amp; ETH - (a 6 years DCA case study),"Inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oen5zp/bought_top_20_coins_100_each_will_update_in_an/), I built a script to analyse if you DCA'd blindly in the top crypto coins vs. investing in BTC &amp; ETH vs investing only in BTC since the beginning of 2015, how much would your total worth is. Here are the results.\n\n**Numbers &amp; assumptions:**\n\n* DCAing takes place every week, on 1st, 8th, 15th and 22th of every month starting from Jan 1st 2015 and until July 6th 2021.\n* Investments budget per week is $100.\n* The weekly investment is divided equally on the coins invested in.\n* This case study is ignoring stable coin investments. E.g.: investing in the top 5 coins means the top 5 coins excluding any stable coins.\n* The analysis is assuming that you invested your money and never sold any coin till now.\n* Total invested money over the whole DCA period is $31,300.\n* Transaction fees are not included in the analysis.\n\n**Here are the results:**\n\n* If you blindly DCA into the top 1 coins (BTC), you will end up with **$1,102,104**.\n* If you blindly DCA into the top 2 coins, you will end up with 4 coins (BTC, XRP, LTC, ETH) in your wallet and total worth of **$1,462,443**.\n* If you blindly DCA into the **top 3 coins**, you will end up with 11 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,310,552.**\n* If you blindly DCA into the **top 5 coins**, you will end up with 23 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,490,189.**\n* If you blindly DCA into the **top 7 coins**, you will end up with 37 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,923,849.**\n* If you blindly DCA into the **top 10 coins**, you will end up with 55 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,316,169.**\n* If you blindly DCA into the **top 20 coins**, you will end up with 130 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,619,756.**\n* If you blindly DCA into the **top 50 coins**, you will end up with 381 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$979,086.**\n* If you had a glass ball and knew that ETH will be what it's today and you invested only in BTC &amp; ETH, you will end up with 2 coins in your wallet (surprise), and a total worth of **$4,505,477.**\n\n**Some observations:**\n\n1. Although it was relatively easier to guess that BTC will be the #1 crypto coin back then, nobody would have guessed for sure that ETH will be #2, so betting on BTC &amp; ETH only from the beginning would've been your strategy only if you know the future. (you are God). Based on that it's safer to say ""I invest in the top X coins"" instead of saying I only invest in coin X and coin Y.\n2. Investing in altcoins in addition to BTC can increase your ROI considerably. Investing in top 7-10 coins tends to yield the most return in this case study (x3).\n3. Based on #2, a crypto ETF (or a similar service from exchanges that allow us to buy in bulk) could give exposure to the top X coins while saving transaction costs considerably.\n\nIf you want more details, here is what your wallet would look like in each case of the above:\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-aRmJBZlb9azXHODN3WFkIVzwxepH3GV/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-aRmJBZlb9azXHODN3WFkIVzwxepH3GV/view?usp=sharing), [https://drive.google.com/file/d/12v45\_cy4hNSiEklZj042SDsgfnKObr4i/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12v45_cy4hNSiEklZj042SDsgfnKObr4i/view?usp=sharing), [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EwFvusdGrOVdagvXqAXrAw0BTUZmKowG/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EwFvusdGrOVdagvXqAXrAw0BTUZmKowG/view?usp=sharing), [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R8hZs7IYED8ksjyera37gWJLzRzcPAXE/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R8hZs7IYED8ksjyera37gWJLzRzcPAXE/view?usp=sharing), [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bRijSf8sZ9J3bIGBY-iiGAQjgbL-vPzu/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bRijSf8sZ9J3bIGBY-iiGAQjgbL-vPzu/view?usp=sharing), [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k4ONNzFqXJ96t9S2xKR8SD88VSMBXYim/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k4ONNzFqXJ96t9S2xKR8SD88VSMBXYim/view?usp=sharing), [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o\_7Nd8TcyfkVS2-OUAvStObUjk-x4j0c/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o_7Nd8TcyfkVS2-OUAvStObUjk-x4j0c/view?usp=sharing), [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xIZv0DpMBO18LgHg-OFKo41WgHiYRFUf/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xIZv0DpMBO18LgHg-OFKo41WgHiYRFUf/view?usp=sharing), [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yGKbXeS6DZic6A1PmM5sGA2A3CZOyzUp/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yGKbXeS6DZic6A1PmM5sGA2A3CZOyzUp/view?usp=sharing)\n\nI**MPORTANT NOTE:** This whole case study was a fun project and i was trying to answer some questions and thought to share it with you in case that would help you in any way.

Update on the market after the Luna Crash,"Hey Guys! I want to update with you on my thoughts on the Crypto market and the recent crashes and also to warn you of few potential dangers. I wanted to post this a couple of days back, but since I was packed up and had limited knowledge on the situation, I waited till I did proper research on this. \n\n**Why did Terra-Money Crash?**\n\nTerra-Money is a stable coin project launched by Do Kwon, it's main objective was to make a truly decentralized Stablecoin (UST) which is not backed by fiat or any other centralised asset, So the LUNA token was born to peg the UST to make sure the UST is stable. Needless to say, even a child can see how weak and volatile that is going to be. It was never really a strong project to begin with regardless of the attacks. \n\n**Will Terra-Money Recover?**\n\nI know its been tough, to hold through this and bleed your money. The network has been halted, Do kwon accepted a community idea of recovering the stable coin which Do Kwon accepted but its highly unlikely that UST will be stable any time soon. the future of LUNA is even dimmer, With the most optimistic thought, I'd say both might survive, But UST won't be a stablecoin and LUNA won't recover for at least a couple of years. \n\n**What does it mean for the rest of the Stablecoins?**\n\nThis just shows, how fragile the market is and to what extent whales can manipulate the price, this was probably the biggest blow, in the history of Investment. However, this is a clear indication of War against Centralised and Decentralised Crypto. Central Banks, Investment firms will short and remove it  from existence if it directly threats them. If you are holding any other Decentralised Stable Coin or a coin which is backing the stablecoin. Watch out!\n\nsome examples are USDD and TRON Coin, DAI and MakerDao, USDN and Waves, and a bunch of other Stable coin which are backed by crypto are all at risk\n\nI am personally not worried for USDC or USDT crashing cause if they do its the end of all economy and Crypto as we know it. \n\n**What does it mean for the rest of the Crypto-Currencies?**\n\nA lot of people are asking/saying things like, this is the end of Crypto Currency, Prices will never recover, etc. These statements has no logic or reason behind them other than pure emotion. \n\nCrypto market will be up again, with or without LUNA. The Economy is at a Crisis, every currency (fiat and crypto) are falling so its natural for other cryptos to be down. Also this Luna crash might have added salt to injury. But there's no point is staying away from them, when they are backed by Literal Countries and a lot of Whales. \n\nBe careful, even though the market will recover, some of the coins will weak fundamentals might never recover. so please focus on the fundamentals and the people behind the project before investing.","Update on the market after the Luna CrashHey Guys!

How to get USDT at a reasonable rate?,"It?s baffling to see the prices of USDT on Binance P2P. The markup is insane. The same goes for all the other cryptos being sold through P2P.

Can we use DeXs in India to convert to INR using P2P thus avoiding the 30% crypto tax?,"I've been reading crypto tax and ways to circumvent it. I feel we should NOT give in to the 30% crypto tax.

Anchor protocol,"Hey folk,\n\nfirst things first. I'm fairly new to the crypto scene as well as to reddit as a network to have a discussion on. So please excuse my clumsy choice of words, if I'm using wrong terms in the following.\n\nI recently stumbled over the anchor protocol of the terra network, which offers various ways to invest money. Even so I'm very impressed with the project's idea, the names of the team and the amount of people already involved, I still have some doubts about how safe it is, to put my money there.\n\nSo as one of various options to stake your money (I will only talk about this one for now), the anchor protocol claims to guarantee 20 APR on the amount of UST that is being deposited. This sound like a crazy good deal regarding the APRs you would currently receive at a bank (at least here in Germany) which would be around 0.5 to 1.0 APR. So the question that springs to mind is, how is that even possible? Are there any catches?\n\nSo I tried to do a little digging (reddit, YouTube, google etc.). Sadly, none of what I found truly explained where the value was created in order to guarantee this 20 APR. Most of the posts took the 20% as good given or explained it with oversimplified examples that would just relocate the question about the creation of value to another part of the example.\n\nTo be fair, I was overstrained reading the white papers, since I m not familiar with IT-terms, as I never got in touch with programming too much. So maybe everything is laid out there and I'm just too stupid to understand it.\n\nAnyhow, the little bit if research I did today as well as the examples posted gave me the impression that the 20 APR is only working as long as the network is growing and we are moving in a bulls market. As I said before, I don't want to imply anything here, I just really hope, someone can give me a little deeply insight to understand the system.\n\nSo here is the given example that supposedly explains, how 20 APR can be maintained:\n\nFirst of all, its presumed that stacked UST can generate a yield of 10-12 APR (even tho I have no idea if that is realistic, I just assume its true since I see how stacking generates value by verifying transactions)\n\n1. Leo deposits 100 $, expects 20 APR = 20 $ for the year\n2. Bob wants to borrow 100 $, so he puts down 300 $ dollar as collateral in order to take Leo's 100 $ as a loan\n3. the anchor protocol stakes Bob#s 300 $ collateral to gain 30 $ ( 10 APR on 300 $)\n4. From this staking earning (30 $), 20 $ go into Leo's pocket for providing the 100 $ loan, the other 10 $ go into some type of pool of the network\n\nSo why would you lock up 300 $ as collateral in order to loan 100 $. Why not work with 100 $ of the 300 $ of your own in the first place? Since the collateral deposited is locked in stacking, you don't get the 100 $ on top of your 300 $ to work with but instead.\n\nSince this doesn't make sense, I tried to figure out why people would loan from the depositors of UST. So apparently if you post bLuna as collateral, you get rewarded which anchor token with insane APR up to 250% (the YouTube video was from march this year). On top of that, you can loan money as states in the example before in order to add it to the collateral value already put down, leading to a bigger amount rewarded with the 250 APR.\n\nto amplify the example before:\n\n5. Bob gets 250 APR in anchor tokens for his 300 $ put down in collateral.\n\n6. He also get 250 APR on the 100 $ loaned from Leo. Therefore he does not mind to pay 30% interest on the 100 $ loaned (10% stacking reward on the 300 $ put down as collateral) since he is still making good profit with 220 APR on the loaned money.\n\nThis leads to the next and even more urgent question. Are these 250% legit?\n\nApparently the APR on the collateral value is flexibel, depending on the amount of collateral value as well as the demand for it.\n\nSo right now the value of an anchor token sits at around 5 dollars. If the prices stays the same, even with more and more value being put down as collateral, the APR in put down collateral value will dip but not go anywhere near 30 APR in the foreseeable future. If demand for the anchor token goes up, the APR might even rise. So for those scenarios, system keeps going.\n\nQuestion is: What happens if the value of anchor token goes down? Since the generated anchor token reward is self compounding and therefor put down as collateral value right away in order to general more anchor token, the ""value"" never really leaves the eco-system of the terra-network. I see the temptation of just putting all the profit right back in the collateral value, since 250% is simply too good to not throw all money spare money you have at it.\n\nBut what happens if someone actually started to cash out? I assume the price of anchor token would drop due to a drop in demand, the APR for collateral value would drop, therefore more people would get out, the value of anchor would drop even more, collateral loaned will be liquidated which all will eventually lead to a downward spiral.\n\nIt looks like the whole thing could go south pretty quickly, once rolling.\n\nSo this leads me to the final question where I want to leave it for now and see if anyone has some more information on this topic.\n\nWhat is the actual value of anchor and how stable is its value?\n\nSince its supposed to carry interest at 250 APR, is there any more value to it, other than being automatically reinvested as collateral value in order to general even more anchor? It seem that other the staking for interest you can also stake anchor tokens in order to participate in votes of the terra network community.\n\nSo this does not quite cut it for me in order to put my money here. The vote option aside. I don't see any value in anchor other than that it might be stacked in order to get more value. The whole system stops working, once the price of anchor drops and people cash out. Everyone not fast enough will lose money or even get liquidated. Since we're in a bull market and the ""auto compounding"" is very convenient, I don't see this happening anytime soon, but I guess it will eventually happen.\n\nI don't know if I'm making any mistakes here, if I'm giving in to any misconception or if everyone else is just blinded by the $$-signs. As I said before. The network and community itself seems so vivid that I really want to participate. But at the same time, most communication stops at a rather superficial level while everything for the team itself is the hard to understand with any IT-background.\n\nLooking forward to hear your thoughts on the topic.","anchor protocol hey folk,\n\nfirst things first. i'm fairly new to the crypto scene as well as to reddit as a network to have a discussion on. so please excuse my clumsy choice of words, if i'm using wrong terms in the following.\n\ni recently stumbled over the anchor protocol of the terra network, which offers various ways to invest money. even so i'm very impressed with the project is idea, the names of the team and the amount of people already involved, i still have some doubts about how safe it is, to put my money there.\n\nso as one of various options to stake your money (i will only talk about this one for now), the anchor protocol claims to guarantee 20 apr on the amount of ust that is being deposited. this sound like a crazy good deal regarding the aprs you would currently receive at a bank (at least here in germany) which would be around 0.5 to 1.0 apr. so the question that springs to mind is, how is that even possible?

Can someone please describe tern to me and how converting other coins to it would work somewhat?,"I've been trying to find the cheapest way to convert any crypto to an actual US dollar.

Social Skills 101 for Crypto Bros,"Saw a question on AskMen subreddit ""What is the male version of astrology girl?"" and to no one's surprise crypto dude is one of the top answers.\n\nLet's be real here, we people who are into crypto have a bad reputation socially. We are at best socially inept, at worst cult-like. The stereotype of the crypto bros is one who tries to 'teach' them about crypto, and get them to convert their hard earned money to the sacred crypto. I have been on dates and the moment I talk about crypto, I can literal feel her pants tighten up, and help her remember that she has something important came up and need to end the date early.\n\nTo help with dispelling this negative image of crypto bros, I decided to write up this post on how to improve our social skills with people.\n\nThe fundamental issue with crypto bros is basing his entire identity around crypto itself. To be fair, basing one's identity to a single thing, like religion, politics, work etc. is a horrible idea. Life is a lot more than just crypto; have some fun hobbies, be proactive in your professional career, be involved in friends and families' lives. I get that you're passionate about crypto and how it will change your life, that doesn't mean you have to shove it down into other people's throat. It's like that annoying Christian dude that won't shut up about Jesus and somehow connecting every conversational topic to him.\n\nI am not advocating for people to actively hide the fact that they're into crypto, if it comes out in a conversation, it comes out. There is a huge difference in responding to the question ""What are you into?"" with ""I'm really into my job (or ""working towards my dream job"" if you hate your job), I'm into (some hobby), and like to trade some crypto on the side."" vs ""Oh I'm really into crypto!"" followed by a 1 hour lecture on crypto. What I'm saying is that it's important to be a well-rounded person and not basing your entire identity on crypto alone.\n\nAn unhealthy mentality crypto bros have is what I call the 'red pill' mentality, where they feel superior just because they're into crypto and the person they're talking to isn't. This same mentality is also commonly found in cults, conspiracy nuts and anti-vaxxers.\n\nAnother important thing, read their body language. If when talking about crypto and you can see they're no longer attentive like looking away or just looking dead in the eye, change the topic. This applies to any conversational topic. If they're not into what you're into, THAT IS OK. If they're interested in crypto, naturally they'll ask you more about it.\n\nRemember a social interaction is a two-way street, where you share about what you're into, they share theirs, and establishing commonalities.

What to look out for when alt season is closing?,"I took up mining and crypto investing back in January. I'm a very compulsive spender, and needed to find better coping mechanisms.

I  need to vent to complete strangers who understand this to some degree.\n\nI  got into crypto last year. I had a massive hunch and went to buy  Dogecoin. I tried to get a small bank loan to buy a million coins this  time last year. I KNEW it was going to go up - despite friends laughing  me off. I didn't get the bank loan because I'm receiving disability  support for an injury that's meant I've been largely bed-bound for  almost half a decade. Before I was a working professional, but the  bank's don't care. I ended up buying 100,00 coins. And got ridiculed and  friends begged me to sell once I made a couple of grand profit. I did.  And then saw the bag soar to $70,000 worth. Sigh. Trust your own gut  right. No one to blame but myself.\n\nAnyway,  moving on. I had some savings that I put into meme coins. I saw profits  soar to 6 figures and didn't cash out - learnt my lesson from last time  didn't I. Only this time it went down. And down.\n\nI  had a cash out target that I was determined to stick to. I was SO close  to the target before the market crashed around May. So fucking close.\n\nTHEN  I made 5-figure profits in another token that I went to cash out, only  there was a new warning message that came up on the exchange I was using  that I hadn't seen before. I couldn't figure out if it was a security  breach or all fine. Turns out it was all fine - just a new message that  company had added. But by the time I got the answer the gains were lost.  $30,000 gains.\n\nClose to a quarter  of a million gains lost.

Questions regarding reddit community tokens,"Hello crypto people,\n\nI am very excited about reddit launching community tokens, I've been dreaming of crypto on reddit for years now and its finally here. Full speed ahead!\n\nBut I want to understand it really well, so here are my questions, any help is welcome!\n\n1. Will the community tokens be available to **trade and sell at outside exchanges**? since they will be on ethereum, we should be able to trade anywhere?\n2. Are the **tokens breakable into decimal numbers**? e.g. 0.001 moon; for example, we can break down 1 BTC into 100,000,000 parts, will this be the same for the community tokens?\n3. I read on the vault page that coins will be burned everytime someone purchases them with dollars. This is great! good deflationary tactic. But the **exact metric of how much is burned** will be nice to know.\n4. I read the max number of tokens will be 250 million, is that for **all tokens across ALL subreddits** or **250 million for each subreddit** that gets tokenized?  I hope it is the latter, because then there will be less competition across subreddits.\n\nA link to something like a whitepaper or some helpful articles will be highly appreciated, I know this is an early stage, but I am extremely happy about this feature and would love to become a beneficiary of this tech.

Experience with investing in crypto has been quite the journey because of the following reasonsâ€¦,"Which cryptos are currently in your portfolio and why?\n\nI am looking to expand my crypto portfolio. I currently have a very nice amount of SHIB (purchased in May). It is doing well and Iâ€™m hoping to see it hit the 1 cent range at least. \n\nI just purchased 30,000,000 in ELON today. Iâ€™m still researching it but didnâ€™t want to waste anytime and miss out on massive gains. Itâ€™s showing Iâ€™m already up 118% and Iâ€™m hoping this crypto can also hit the 1 cent range at least.\n\nI have BTT (BitTorrent) and Iâ€™m in the negative with that. I purchased just under 12,000 at an average of 0.007136. I could lower my average and purchase more now at 0.003937 but Iâ€™m unsure if itâ€™s worth it? Iâ€™m doing my own DD and research but honestly it seems as if nothing is following the norm anymore. \n\nIt wasnâ€™t expected for SHIB to do what itâ€™s doing now anytime soon. I expected to see minimal growth from SHIB over the next year but it is exceeding expectations. Sure what goes up must come down but from my entry point Iâ€™ve only had extreme gains through all the dips.\n\nWhich other cryptos are you investing in that have a reasonable entry point. ETH and BTC are too far gone to see any real return in my opinion. I may not have a full understanding of how investing $5 a week in a crypto thatâ€™s already at $60K plus will benefit me (same concept with ETH). \n\nThere are exchanges and swaps to purchase Safemoon or RyoshiVision but Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s worth it at this point considering high gas fees?\n\nAny tips on apps, websites, books, etc to download or read to stay up to date with crypto? As well as just advance my overall knowledge of it.\n\nI want to have short and long term investments. I once before had DOGE but got out after Elonâ€™s SNL performance. Would you recommend buying back in? Itâ€™s hard to see it hitting a $1.00. I would be entering in around 0.30 and Iâ€™m not sure I could buy enough to see any real growth. Do you think DOGE will exceed a dollar and why?\n\nDoes anyone have any logical thoughts (not just meme coin hate) on SHIB or ELON? \n\nIf you have any cryptos to recommend do you mind explaining why you invested in them and where you are doing your research?\n\nIâ€™m not looking for someone to tell me what to invest in and become a millionaire overnight. I am simply asking questions to be pointed in the right direction. I know we all would like to know which cryptos will be the next Bitcoin.\n\nI donâ€™t want to miss any other cryptos taking off as I feel cryptocurrency is the future. Iâ€™m only 21 and am hoping to be able to rely heavily on my investments in the future. That is if I invest in the right ones.

Yield Farming FTW? A Critical View on Risks in DeFi,"The  new focus on DeFi governance yield farming and recent  memory of Black  Thursday amplifies concerns about the poorly understood  structure of  risks in DeFi. We (researchers at Cornell and Imperial College London)  have been working on a risk-based model to help better understand the  involved risks.\n\nAs such, we  provide a new foundation for characterizing and modeling these risks;  this is developed in the context of stablecoins but is more widely  applicable to many crypto-economic systems, including cross-chain  protocols (think Ren, tBTC, wBTC), collateralized lending (think  Compound, Aave, dYdX), and decentralized exchanges (think Uniswap,  Curve, Balancer). Our framework focuses on measures of incentive  security, meaning that participation is mutually profitable for all  parties after accounting for attack surfaces, and economic stability,  which poses the question of whether incentives actually lead to stable  outcomes.\n\nWe identify an important  sustainability concern: in some DeFi systems designed with broad  governance powers and without societal recourse, the equilibrium  participation of rational agents may be zero. This is because the cost  to align incentives in these systems may be prohibitively high (an  analogy is requiring a bank to have a long-term P/E ratio of 1000 to be  secure against the theft of depositor funds). Our framework provides a  means to model these systems and yields an array of unanswered research  questions that will be critical for DeFi going forward.\n\nTwitter thread: [https://twitter.com/aklamun/status/1275544741086736384](https://twitter.com/aklamun/status/1275544741086736384)\n\nBlog post: [https://medium.com/coinmonks/stablecoins-2-0-economic-foundations-for-defi-b9ab38500b87](https://medium.com/coinmonks/stablecoins-2-0-economic-foundations-for-defi-b9ab38500b87)\n\nAcademic paper: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12388.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12388.pdf)","yield farming ftw? a critical view on risks in defi the new focus on defi governance yield farming and recent memory of black thursday amplifies concerns about the poorly understood structure of risks in defi. we (researchers at cornell and imperial college london) have been working on a risk-based model to help better understand the involved risks.\n\nas such, we provide a new foundation for characterizing and modeling these risks; this is developed in the context of stablecoins but is more widely applicable to many crypto-economic systems, including cross-chain protocols (think ren, tbtc, wbtc), collateralized lending (think compound, aave, dydx), and decentralized exchanges (think uniswap, curve, balancer). our framework focuses on measures of incentive security, meaning that participation is mutually profitable for all parties after accounting for attack surfaces, and economic stability, which poses the question of whether incentives actually lead to stable outcomes.\n\nwe identify an important sustainability concern: in some defi systems designed with broad governance powers and without societal recourse, the equilibrium participation of rational agents may be zero. this is because the cost to align incentives in these systems may be prohibitively high (an analogy is requiring a bank to have a long-term p/e ratio of 1000 to be secure against the theft of depositor funds). our framework provides a means to model these systems and yields an array of unanswered research questions that will be critical for defi going forward.\n\ntwitter thread: [ post: [ paper: [",2,0,1,

Few questions from a newcomer.,"Hey bros.\n\nI have been interested in crypto for a few months now, but I'am a total newcomer. That is to say I don't have any skin in the crypto game.\n\nThe bull market is going to end soon I assume. Prices are high so buying now seems pointless for a long term hodl. Anything I would buy would lose portion of it's value after the bull market, right?\n\nBuying stable coins would solve the price issue. However, and I'am not an expert, but with how much USD is being printed, isn't a crash inevitable? Meaning if I bought let's say usdt, when USD crashes the crypto pegged to it goes down too?\n\nI want to slowly convert the money from my savings account to replace it with crypto.

It?s a peer-to-peer system that enables anyone to send and receive payments anywhere. Instead of being physical money carried around and exchanged in the real world, cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries to an online database describing specific transactions. The transactions are recorded in a public ledger when you transfer cryptocurrency funds. Cryptocurrency is stored in digital wallets.\n\nCryptocurrency received its name because it uses encryption to verify transactions. This means advanced coding is involved in storing and transmitting cryptocurrency data between wallets and public ledgers. The aim of encryption is to provide security and safety.\n\nThe first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, founded in 2009,d is the best known today. Much of the interest in cryptocurrencies is to trade for profit, with speculators at times driving prices skyward.

 \nCryptocurrency is a digital payment system that doesn't rely on banks to verify transactions. It?s a peer-to-peer system that enables anyone to send and receive payments anywhere. Instead of being physical money carried around and exchanged in the real world, cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries to an online database describing specific transactions. The transactions are recorded in a public ledger when you transfer cryptocurrency funds. Cryptocurrency is stored in digital wallets.\n\nCryptocurrency received its name because it uses encryption to verify transactions. This means advanced coding is involved in storing and transmitting cryptocurrency data between wallets and public ledgers. The aim of encryption is to provide security and safety.\n\nThe first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, founded in 2009,d is the best known today. Much of the interest in cryptocurrencies is to trade for profit, with speculators at times driving prices skyward.

"Independent, mainstream-accessible, decentralized stock markets for the blockchain [Feedback wanted]"," Hey guys,  \n   \njust wanted to get feedback from you wonderful people on a project I am part of. I promise not to shill though, I'm just looking for a discussion!   \n\n\nWe are launching (in three weeks) a blockchain for decentralized capital markets. At the core of everything is an AMM that we have invented that infers virtual liquidity, no need for collateral or liquidity providers. The first application we are launching is a decentralized, independent stock exchange. Price discovery will happen from the beginning, on every asset from Tesla to Apple, entirely independent of existing centralized exchanges. This is the only way to overcome the regulatory problems with other approaches as well as the technical problems of using oracles.   \n\n\nWe have also built a Web2 interface and custodial wallet solution that lets mainstream users access it. We have the same game theory and mechanics as traditional markets, but many more participants (because everyone in the world can use it). This means that the markets on our chain can start to lead other more traditional exchanges. The other key aspect is that the L1 token for the chain also receives a portion of the trading fees on each of the protocols. It becomes an asset backed token and is sort of equivalent to owning a piece of the NYSE.  \n\n\nAny thoughts? Would love to dive deeper into any aspect that you guys find interesting.","Independent, mainstream-accessible, decentralized stock markets for the blockchain [Feedback wanted] Hey guys,  \n   \njust wanted to get feedback from you wonderful people on a project I am part of.

We Are Building a Truly Decentralized Investment Platform and Would Love to Hear Your Feedback," \n\nHi everyone, My name is Kevin, I?m the co-founder at [DeStreet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wiser.app), where we are building a truly decentralized investment platform that is borderless, safe, secure while remaining easy to use for mainstream users. We would like to hear your feedback on our project!\n\nCurrent solutions are either centralized,  while putting a lot of restrictions on the users (quite ironic when you preach decentralization!) and pose custodial risks and many defi projects are built for crypto natives with a multitude of steps that makes things too complicated for a mainstream user. \n\nRight now, on DeStreet, you can purchase coins that are on the polygon network. We have integrated  DEX aggregator 1inch ([https://1inch.io/aggregation-protocol/](https://1inch.io/aggregation-protocol/)) to get you the best prices.\n\n**Onboarding**\n\nWe don?t do any KYC since we are not a crypto exchange, only a platform.\n\nSo our onboarding is very quick, takes less than 2 minutes. Just enter your email, you will receive an OTP and you are good to go.\n\n**Key Management:**\n\nAs soon as you sign up, we generate a wallet for you. We use [Magic](https://magic.link/) (formerly, Fortmatic) for authentication and wallet recovery (no more seed phrases!). Your wallet is linked to your email and you can recover it anytime you want.\n\nWe are fully non-custodial, so neither us nor Magic can ever see your keys. You are free to transfer your coins without any limitations (we can?t suspend withdrawals during a crash even if we want to XD)\n\nMagic?s delegated key management system uses AWS KMS to store your keys in Hardware Security Modules (HSMs), which work similar to hardware wallets like Ledger, Trezor etc. All encryption and decryption operations happen inside the HSMs themselves, so an attacker can?t just leak your encrypted keys to the world and hope to brute force it. \n\nYou can read Magic?s whitepaper here: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/3flqaszoigwis5b/Magic%20Whitepaper.pdf?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3flqaszoigwis5b/Magic%20Whitepaper.pdf?dl=0)\n\n**Buy using INR**\n\nFor Indian users, we have partnered with OnMeta for fiat on-ramps. It is well integrated within our platform so the user experience is much better and your don?t have to deal with any p2p scams.\n\nIf you are outside India you can use Transak for fiat conversion. It is also integrated within our platform. \n\n**Fees:**\n\nWe don?t charge any trading fee. Though you will have to pay the polygon network (gas) fee, which currently is hovering around Rs.1- 2 per trade. However, 1inch will charge a trade fee based on the DEXes it uses for your trade (the rates are lower or similar to most centralized exchanges depending on the pair)\n\n**Transfer**\n\nThere won?t be any limitation in transferring coins to or from our platform. Since we are only a platform, we don?t facilitate fiat withdrawals. Onmeta is working on this, so hopefully it will be available soon. Other manual options like using Incento or Cryptorefills to withdraw are given in our app. \n\n**What?s Next**\n\n1. We will be adding more chains to expand our coin offerings\n2. We will be adding more yield bearing products\n3. Curated data and research to help you make informed investment decisions (DYOR made easier)\n4. Releasing the iOS version soon. If you are an iOS user please [join our waitlist here](https://forms.gle/TnPA9A6RH8qZFmiV9)\n\nIf you are interested to get early access to new features please [sign up for our beta](https://forms.gle/QrwgxF8arEGsuD9o8) \n\nYou can check our android app at: [https://app.destreet.co](https://app.destreet.co/)\n\n**Screenshots**\n\nHomepage - [https://i.imgur.com/pbuKCWO.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/pbuKCWO.jpg)\n\nBuy/Sell - [https://i.imgur.com/QEQaeHX.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/QEQaeHX.jpg), [https://i.imgur.com/AsPbwy0.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/AsPbwy0.jpg)\n\nWallet - [https://i.imgur.com/nUC032A.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/nUC032A.jpg)\n\nTop Up - [https://i.imgur.com/4Bktv2O.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/4Bktv2O.jpg)\n\nPortfolio - [https://i.imgur.com/tp9GdiH.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/tp9GdiH.jpg)","We Are Building a Truly Decentralized Investment Platform and Would Love to Hear Your Feedback \n\nHi everyone, My name is Kevin, I?m the co-founder at [DeStreet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wiser.app), where we are building a truly decentralized investment platform that is borderless, safe, secure while remaining easy to use for mainstream users.

Crypto Royale (ROY) provides good risk-reward,"I think there is a good risk-reward opportunity with Crypto Royale (ROY), a Harmony One based blockchain game.\n\nPROS\n\nGraydon, a Youtuber is making on average $3 per hour at current rates - https://youtu.be/SsaRA0bLKHM\n\nThis may seem trivial but Cubaâ€™s average monthly salary is approx $40. A University Professor in Cuba was earning $60 per month - https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=422&amp;v=0RjRqS5vl-Q&amp;feature=youtu.be\n\nParts of Russia itâ€™s $350 a month for jobs like train station staff - https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=882&amp;v=kVB20yiNCPE&amp;feature=youtu.be\n\nCrypto Royale (ROY) @12hrs per day = $39 so $273 per 7 day week. Obviously there are a lot of assumptions here. \n\nROY has already tripled over the last few weeks based on smaller volumes - https://info.viper.exchange/token/0xfe1b516a7297eb03229a8b5afad80703911e81cb\n\nCrypto Royale (ROY) can be exchanged to One via ViperSwap providing a cheaper route to swap to One or USDC etc.\n\nCurrent market cap fully diluted is $6.4m with an intention to burn 230m ROY so potentially a market cap of $2.72m\n\n93% staking rewards + 10% more for connecting Discord. This APR has been dropping.\n\nCONS\n\nThe game itself is pretty trivial but so is Axie Infinity and a host of other games, itâ€™s essentially opinions but I see nothing distinctive in Crypto Royale but so are so many other crypto games that are more established like Wall Street Games\n\nUsual risks of fraud, rugpulls, dilutions etc\n\nObviously long hours and practise are required to start winning games and earning but I donâ€™t think people quite get how much $250+ achieves in many countries outside of North America and most of Europe.\n\nCrypto Royale is free entry to lower stake games and a small amount of ROY for higher reward games\n\nObviously there are a tonne of other info some of which has already been posted around Reddit but itâ€™s mainly the financial opportunities for users that I see which I think with more exposure could produce a lot of substantial uptake of ROY.

I try to make follow up posts within a week, but I am behind at the moment. I try to mix in the most popular projects, along with some long shots. Sometimes I even feature projects I personally am not a fan of, just for the sake of conversation. I feel it is important for us to focus on the pros and cons of all projects, even if that sometimes means playing devil's advocate. At this point, I plan to try to continue making these posts until I have completed a full year.?\n\n-If you decide to reply, please add something more than, ""scam"" or ""this coin will moon to $1000 by the end of 2020"". Please say why. If it is a scam, link or show evidence. If you feel it is a true moonshot, what makes this project special with that sort of potential? It seems many people within this community only promote projects they are financially invested in, while trash talking coins they do not hold bags.?\n\n\n-I strongly encourage everyone to follow up on past discussions and you can still make comments on them. There is a lot of valuable information on many of these posts, so please check them out as you have time. You may learn a lot regarding some of these projects. I know I certainly did!\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/search?q=author%3Ajoenorwood77&amp;restrict_sr=on\n\n-These posts are not meant to be financial advice, but instead to be an educational discussion.

TOP COINS THAT SURVIVED CRYPTO CRASH-2022," \n\nAre you wondering about the crypto crash and the coins that survived the major crash? The majority of the most valuable crypto coin have lost as much as 40% of their value in the last few weeks, which has caused the cryptocurrency market to experience some turbulence. This also covers digital currencies like Terra, Ethereum, and Bitcoin.\n\nThe main cause of the gloomy feeling in the cryptocurrency market is fear. Crypto investors panicked and started selling other coins as well as Terra as it plummeted, ultimately destroying the cryptocurrency industry. Few cryptocurrencies are hanging by a thread in this severe bear market and may not make it out alive. But for present, there are some encouraging signals for the bitcoin sector. The top 7 cryptocurrencies that could survive a cryptocurrency market crash listed in this article.\n\nTop 7 Crypto Coins\n\n**Litecoin**\n\nBy former Google engineer Charles ?Charlie? Lee in October 2011, Litecoin emerged as a competing cryptocurrency. The open-source code of Bitcoin used to create Litecoin, but changes made. The foundation of Litecoin is the same as that of Bitcoin: an open-source, decentralised global payment network. The adoption of Script as a proof-of-work algorithm and the quicker block creation rate are two ways that Litecoin differentiates from Bitcoin.\n\n**Polygon Matic**\n\nThe Polygon platform connects Ethereum-based projects and runs on the Ethereum blockchain. While maintaining the security, interoperability, and structural advantages of the Ethereum blockchain, using the Polygon platform can boost the flexibility, scalability, and sovereignty of a blockchain enterprise.\n\nSince MATIC is an ERC-20 token, it can used with other cryptocurrencies based on the Ethereum platform.\n\n**Dogecoin**\n\nThe first meme coin to ever join the cryptocurrency market was Dogecoin (DOGE). Dogecoin initially invented as a joke. However, it appears that the adorable dog won over a lot of people because Dogecoin immediately took off and joined the ranks of the crypto heavyweights. Elon Musk, a fintech expert, frequently tweets about his support for Dogecoin (DOGE). Every time he tweets, Dogecoin is seen by his 50 million Twitter followers, who seize the chance to buy the cryptocurrency, driving up its price.\n\n**Shiba Inu**\n\nRyoshi, a nondescript creator, was the brains behind Shiba Inu (SHIB). Despite being created to parody Dogecoin, it immediately became popular on its own. They are currently both among the top 20 most valuable cryptocurrencies. Shiba Inu is also experiencing growth. At the time of writing, it had gone up 1.785 percent in the previous 24 hours\n\n**Solana**\n\nDecentralized financial (Defi) solutions are offered by the fully functional open-source project Solana, which relies on the permissionlessness of blockchain technology. Although the project?s conception and preliminary work started in 2017, the Solana Foundation, which has its main office in Geneva, Switzerland, formally launched Solana in March of that year. There are 319,790,577 SOL coins in circulation, and the maximum supply is not known.\n\n**Cardano**\n\nCardano was established in 2017 and was given its name in honour of the Italian polymath Gerolamo Cardano. The 19th-century mathematician Ada Lovelace, widely considered as the first computer programmer, is the inspiration behind the naming of the native ADA token. It has a maximum supply of 45,000,000,000 ADA coins and a circulating circulation of 33,626,396,776 ADA coins.\n\n**Avalanche**\n\nA layer one blockchain called Avalanche serves as a foundation for decentralised applications and private blockchain networks. One of Ethereum?s competitors, it seeks to dethrone Ethereum as the most widely used blockchain for smart contracts. By having a larger transaction output of up to 6,500 transactions per second without sacrificing scalability, it seeks to achieve this. There are 245,532,531 AVAX coins in circulation, and the maximum supply is not known.\n\nCryptocurrency cannot be eradicated since it was created to be disruptive and usher in a new financial era. Cryptocurrencies won?t come to an end during a bear market brought on by the waxing and waning of conventional macro cycles. Even while some people might lose money, some would HODL, and some might even buy more, cryptocurrency will rebound. For investors, it?s merely a chance to purchase more.","TOP COINS THAT SURVIVED CRYPTO CRASH-2022 \n\nAre you wondering about the crypto crash and the coins that survived the major crash?

Discussion of the Day: Ampleforth (AMPL),"-Today's Crypto of the Day is Ampleforth (AMPL), and it's current price is $0.8598.\n\n\n-Since 2/18/20, every day I have featured a new crypto of the day for us to discuss. I try to make follow up posts within a week, but I am behind at the moment. I try to mix in the most popular projects, along with some long shots. Sometimes I even feature projects I personally am not a fan of, just for the sake of conversation. I feel it is important for us to focus on the pros and cons of all projects, even if that sometimes means playing devil's advocate. At this point, I plan to try to continue making these posts until I have completed a full year.?\n\n-If you decide to reply, please add something more than, ""scam"" or ""this coin will moon to $1000 by the end of 2020"". Please say why. If it is a scam, link or show evidence. If you feel it is a true moonshot, what makes this project special with that sort of potential? It seems many people within this community only promote projects they are financially invested in, while trash talking coins they do not hold bags.?\n\n\n-I strongly encourage everyone to follow up on past discussions and you can still make comments on them. There is a lot of valuable information on many of these posts, so please check them out as you have time. You may learn a lot regarding some of these projects. I know I certainly did!\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/search?q=author%3Ajoenorwood77&amp;restrict_sr=on\n\n-These posts are not meant to be financial advice, but instead to be an educational discussion.

Crypto is FAST- Here's Why That Matters," \n\nCryptocurrency has a lot of benefits over traditional payment mechanisms. It is decentralized, and it has an algorithmically determined money supply that leads to a stable currency. Those are all very important benefits, but to the everyday user, they might seem a little bit abstract. The everyday user just wants a simple, fast, effective payment mechanism to use without hassle. In this article, I wanted to take a little bit of time and discuss one of the **more tangible benefits of cryptocurrency usage for normal, everyday users - the quick payment settling speed.**\n\n**Slow Speeds Create Disagreement**\n\nWith traditional payment methods, such as credit cards, it can take anywhere from 24 hours to three days for funds to move from one person's bank account to another person's bank account. Obviously, this can create confusion and disagreement if one person thinks they have paid for something but the other person has not yet received funds in their bank account.\n\nImagine for a moment that you pay for a airplane flight, hotel reservation, or bus ticket with your credit card on Tuesday night. When you show up on Wednesday for your hotel or flight, the business owner politely notifies you that you will need to pay them since they have not yet received anything from your account. Both parties believe that they are in the right. If you paid with your credit card on a Tuesday night, you could easily look at your bank account and see that you had pending charges. At the same time, the merchants would not yet have any payment received in their account. Even though both parties have the best of intentions, the length of time that it takes to settle this payment can cause disagreement and cause both parties to suspect each other of wrongdoing. The merchant would think that the customer is trying to avoid paying , and the customer would think that the merchant is trying to double charge them.Â \n\n**Crypto Provides Speed and Certainty**\n\nNow, instead of paying with credit cards, let's suppose that we were paying with the USDC stablecoin or the Dai stablecoin. These are both cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of $1 and are exchanged on the Ethereum network. According to eth gas station, it currently takes about 19 cents to make a transfer that will process and settle in about 2 minutes. Remember that the average credit card charge takes between 24 hours and 3 days to settle. Even if we give credit cards the benefit of the doubt and assume that every transfer happens at the fast end of that spectrum and completes in 24 hours, that still means that transferring USDC or Dai is over 720x faster.\n\nThis fast transfer speed is important because it gives both parties the confirmation that payment has been tendered and payment has also been received. Perhaps even more importantly, this record of transfer is publicly available in an immutable blockchain that can be reviewed and consulted in case there is ever a discrepancy on whether somebody actually paid or not.\n\nCryptocurrency offers a whole host of benefits over traditional payment methods, but even if we discount the importance of decentralization or censorship resistance, cryptocurrency can still offer many improvements over traditional payment methods. The long delay that it takes to process pending charges via traditional credit card can be a source of confusion and disagreement between merchants and customers. The ability to conduct near-instantaneous transfers and settle payments quickly is just one more actual use case that will make crypto the money of the future.\n\n**References**\n\n[CreditCardProcessing.com](https://www.creditcardprocessing.com/2013/12/long-take-merchant-receive-funds/)\n\n[Eth Gas Station](https://www.ethgasstation.info/)\n\nImage Credit\n\n[https://unsplash.com/@sortino](https://unsplash.com/@sortino)","crypto is fast- here is why that matters \n\ncryptocurrency has a lot of benefits over traditional payment mechanisms. it is decentralized, and it has an algorithmically determined money supply that leads to a stable currency. those are all very important benefits, but to the everyday user, they might seem a little bit abstract. the everyday user just wants a simple, fast, effective payment mechanism to use without hassle. in this article, i wanted to take a little bit of time and discuss one of the **more tangible benefits of cryptocurrency usage for normal, everyday users - the quick payment settling speed.**\n\n**slow speeds create disagreement**\n\nwith traditional payment methods, such as credit cards, it can take anywhere from 24 hours to three days for funds to move from one person is bank account to another person is bank account. obviously, this can create confusion and disagreement if one person thinks they have paid for something but the other person has not yet received funds in their bank account.\n\nimagine for a moment that you pay for a airplane flight, hotel reservation, or bus ticket with your credit card on tuesday night. when you show up on wednesday for your hotel or flight, the business owner politely notifies you that you will need to pay them since they have not yet received anything from your account. both parties believe that they are in the right. if you paid with your credit card on a tuesday night, you could easily look at your bank account and see that you had pending charges. at the same time, the merchants would not yet have any payment received in their account. even though both parties have the best of intentions, the length of time that it takes to settle this payment can cause disagreement and cause both parties to suspect each other of wrongdoing. the merchant would think that the customer is trying to avoid paying , and the customer would think that the merchant is trying to double charge them.Â \n\n**crypto provides speed and certainty**\n\nnow, instead of paying with credit cards, let is suppose that we were paying with the usdc stablecoin or the dai stablecoin. these are both cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of $1 and are exchanged on the ethereum network. according to eth gas station, it currently takes about 19 cents to make a transfer that will process and settle in about 2 minutes. remember that the average credit card charge takes between 24 hours and 3 days to settle. even if we give credit cards the benefit of the doubt and assume that every transfer happens at the fast end of that spectrum and completes in 24 hours, that still means that transferring usdc or dai is over 720x faster.\n\nthis fast transfer speed is important because it gives both parties the confirmation that payment has been tendered and payment has also been received. perhaps even more importantly, this record of transfer is publicly available in an immutable blockchain that can be reviewed and consulted in case there is ever a discrepancy on whether somebody actually paid or not.\n\ncryptocurrency offers a whole host of benefits over traditional payment methods, but even if we discount the importance of decentralization or censorship resistance, cryptocurrency can still offer many improvements over traditional payment methods. the long delay that it takes to process pending charges via traditional credit card can be a source of confusion and disagreement between merchants and customers. the ability to conduct near-instantaneous transfers and settle payments quickly is just one more actual use case that will make crypto the money of the future.\n\n**references**\n\n[creditcardprocessing.com]( gas station]( credit\n\n[",2,0,3,

"3 Reasons Why Bitcoin Can Go Below $20,000","Lets take a quick look on the [3 Reasons Why Bitcoin Can go Below $20,000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swm9oPml-u8)\n\nFirstly, on the Bitcoin Weekly Chart, we see that the 200 Week SMA is currently at about $14,000. History tells us that the 200 Week SMA is where Bitcoin Bottoms Out. Hence, the first reason is the 200 Week SMA and our price target is $14,000.\n\nSecondly, on the Bitcoin 6 Months chart, we see that we have closed the last candle about 5 days back and it was a shooting star candle. Shooting star candlesticks are found at the top of an uptrend. This indicates that we might be in a correction phase for the the next 1 to 2 candles which is about 6 to 12 months. On inspecting the first level of support on this chart we see that it is down to $14,000 which becomes our price target.\n\nLastly, on the Bitcoin 5 days chart, we plot the Gaussian Channel. History tells us that when ever we go below the bottom line of the Gaussian Channel, we tend to correct by approximately 50%. Therefore, a 50% correction from the current bottom of the Gaussian Channel takes us to about $14,000.","3 Reasons Why Bitcoin Can Go Below $20,000 Lets take a quick look on the [3 Reasons Why Bitcoin Can go Below $20,000]( on the Bitcoin Weekly Chart, we see that the 200 Week SMA is currently at about $14,000.

On inspecting the first level of support on this chart we see that it is down to $14,000 which becomes our price target.\n\nLastly, on the Bitcoin 5 days chart, we plot the Gaussian Channel. History tells us that when ever we go below the bottom line of the Gaussian Channel, we tend to correct by approximately 50%. Therefore, a 50% correction from the current bottom of the Gaussian Channel takes us to about $14,000.",2,0,3,

Tips for New or Existing Crypto Investors,"Happy New Years everyone! Here are some resolutions and things to remember when going into 2022. \n\n1) Always invest in the King and Queen. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most solid projects in crypto are will anchor your portfolio. \n2) Diversify but not too much. Do not put all your eggs in one basket but dont over spread. Too hard to manage and keep up to date with everything. \n3) If it sounds too good to be true, it more than likely is. Yes you can make good profits from crypto but the odds of becoming a millionaire overnight is not realistic at all for 99% of crypto users. \n4) Remember to take Profits (DCA out). Yes I know we all love to Hodl and I'm saying you shouldn't, I am saying make sure and capitalize on the stretches of gains. Take some out and stake with stable coins. When a dip happens, sell stable coins and then buy. \n5) Careful with the Memecoins. Have some fun in life and gamble a little but remember, it is very much a gamble. \n6) DYOR. Make sure and do your own research people and do not blindly follow people. Most people around here, myself included, have little to no idea what is actually going to happen. \n7) Remember that time in market is better than timing the market. As mentioned before, becoming a millionaire doesn't happen overnight. \n8) Only invest what you can afford to lose! Investments are never a sure thing. Be prepared to lose it all. If you can live with that, then you are in a comfortable place. \n9) Set a goal and be happy when you reach it. Dont be greedy here people. If you goal is to pay for college, get that down payment for a house (or buy a house), get a new car if you need it, then buy means do it! Don't be too greedy here people. \n10) Take Care of yourself. There is life outside staring at a screen all day long! Make sure and remember to life your life!","tips for new or existing crypto investors happy new years everyone! here are some resolutions and things to remember when going into 2022. \n\n1) always invest in the king and queen. bitcoin and ethereum are the most solid projects in crypto are will anchor your portfolio. \n2) diversify but not too much. do not put all your eggs in one basket but dont over spread. too hard to manage and keep up to date with everything. \n3) if it sounds too good to be true, it more than likely is. yes you can make good profits from crypto but the odds of becoming a millionaire overnight is not realistic at all for 99% of crypto users. \n4) remember to take profits (dca out). yes i know we all love to hodl and i'm saying you shouldn't, i am saying make sure and capitalize on the stretches of gains. take some out and stake with stable coins. when a dip happens, sell stable coins and then buy. \n5) careful with the memecoins. have some fun in life and gamble a little but remember, it is very much a gamble. \n6) dyor. make sure and do your own research people and do not blindly follow people. most people around here, myself included, have little to no idea what is actually going to happen. \n7) remember that time in market is better than timing the market. as mentioned before, becoming a millionaire doesn't happen overnight. \n8) only invest what you can afford to lose! investments are never a sure thing. be prepared to lose it all. if you can live with that, then you are in a comfortable place. \n9) set a goal and be happy when you reach it. dont be greedy here people. if you goal is to pay for college, get that down payment for a house (or buy a house), get a new car if you need it, then buy means do it! don't be too greedy here people. \n10) take care of yourself. there is life outside staring at a screen all day long! make sure and remember to life your life!",2,0,3,

Discussion of the Day: Grid+ (GRID),"-Today's Crypto of the Day is Grid+ (GRID), and it's current price is $0.1998.\n\n\nSince 2/18/20, every day I have featured a new crypto of the day for us to discuss. Originally, I was making follow posts within a week or so. Now I am unable to provide more information than what I find on CoinMarketCap, and sometimes a video from The Coin Bureau. I kindly ask that everyone do their own research, and please share any information and/or questions you may have.

An open discussion on EIP-1559,"I?m curious what people think about EIP-1559. You can find a good explanation of the proposal [here.](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/ethereum-improvement-proposal-ETH-gas-fee)\n\nThis, along with ETH 2.0 and drastic reduction of block rewards is why I?m so bullish on ETH. \n\nEIP-1559 is very controversial however. Here?s a TL;DR on Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559\n\n- The current auction-based fee system that a lot of other popular coins use will potentially be done away with. \n\n- Users will pay a static fee with the option of a tip. The fee will be burned (removes ETH from circulation) and the tips will go to the miners. \n\n- The goal is to fill half the block with standard transactions and the other half with tipped transactions. \n\n- The base fee will increase and decrease. If all available transactions will fill 50% or the block the base fee rises. If they fill less than 50% of the block the fee falls. \n\n- The tip is a way to ensure you?re in the next block. This bit is the controversial part to me. It?s removing an auction system but keeping an auction system for 50% of a block. \n\n- Flexible block sizes are on the table. \n\n- This promises to DRASTICALLY reduce the fees for ETH transactions and start to deflate ETH by burning the base fees. This is good for upward price movement. \n\n\nI am a miner (albeit not as big as I was when I had 36 1070s mining in 2017) and I?m all for this EIP. Bigger miners aren?t as big a fan. They see fees being burned and issuance being cut and they?re nervous. \n\nI feel like this will be moot when ETH 2.0 merges with ETH. ETH 2.0 is live right now and is dubbed The Beacon Chain. Soon (hopefully end of 2021) ETH as it stands today will be added to ETH 2.0\nas a shard of the Beacon Chain. More elaborate sharding capabilities will go live in 2022. \n\n\nOverall I think EIP-1559 is a nice addition to the move to staking vs mining. Reducing supply of ETH will promote upward price movement and take a ton of stress off the ETH network, where fees are incredibly high right now. \n\nWhat do you all think? I?m curious about the community?s thoughts about not only 1559 but how the network will respond to the end of GPU mining of ETH. \n\nAt minimum us gamers are finally going to be able to buy GPUs to game without having to sell a kidney to afford one :) \n\nETH?s future is bright! \n\nFull disclosure - right now about 70% of my portfolio is in ETH and ETH 2.0 staking. I?ve been in crypto since late 2011. \n\nCheers all!","an open discussion on eip-1559 im curious what people think about eip-1559. you can find a good explanation of the proposal [here.]( along with eth 2.0 and drastic reduction of block rewards is why im so bullish on eth. \n\neip-1559 is very controversial however. heres a tl;dr on ethereum improvement proposal (eip) 1559\n\n- the current auction-based fee system that a lot of other popular coins use will potentially be done away with. \n\n- users will pay a static fee with the option of a tip. the fee will be burned (removes eth from circulation) and the tips will go to the miners. \n\n- the goal is to fill half the block with standard transactions and the other half with tipped transactions. \n\n- the base fee will increase and decrease. if all available transactions will fill 50% or the block the base fee rises. if they fill less than 50% of the block the fee falls. \n\n- the tip is a way to ensure youre in the next block. this bit is the controversial part to me. its removing an auction system but keeping an auction system for 50% of a block. \n\n- flexible block sizes are on the table. \n\n- this promises to drastically reduce the fees for eth transactions and start to deflate eth by burning the base fees. this is good for upward price movement. \n\n\ni am a miner (albeit not as big as i was when i had 36 1070s mining in 2017) and im all for this eip. bigger miners arent as big a fan. they see fees being burned and issuance being cut and theyre nervous. \n\ni feel like this will be moot when eth 2.0 merges with eth. eth 2.0 is live right now and is dubbed the beacon chain. soon (hopefully end of 2021) eth as it stands today will be added to eth 2.0\nas a shard of the beacon chain. more elaborate sharding capabilities will go live in 2022. \n\n\noverall i think eip-1559 is a nice addition to the move to staking vs mining. reducing supply of eth will promote upward price movement and take a ton of stress off the eth network, where fees are incredibly high right now. \n\nwhat do you all think? im curious about the communitys thoughts about not only 1559 but how the network will respond to the end of gpu mining of eth. \n\nat minimum us gamers are finally going to be able to buy gpus to game without having to sell a kidney to afford one :) \n\neths future is bright! \n\nfull disclosure - right now about 70% of my portfolio is in eth and eth 2.0 staking. ive been in crypto since late 2011. \n\ncheers all!",2,0,3,

"Newbies to crypto, these are somethings I wish I learned at first before entering crypto.","People are bound to make mistakes in crypto. I made alot. But thanks to my own research and this sub I was able to learn new things and stay away from doing more mistakes. \n\nSo here are a few you should know.\n\n1. Bitcoin/ETH isn't expensive. You can buy it in fractions. If bitcoin goes up 5%, whatever that amount you've invested will also go up 5%. Don't refrain from buying coins like BTC and ETH cause you think it's expensive.  This is a very common mistake that everyone does at first.\n\n2. Don't buy shitcoins. Stay away from all coins that have dogs and safe in it. Don't buy coins just cause you can get millions of coins just for $10. \n\n3. Apart from listening to this sub ,do your own research. Learn about the coin and it's purpose, team, etc etc.\n\n4. Hodl. Don't panic sell. Make it a rule never to sell in loss. If it's a good coin, it will go up. Zoom out the charts. Time in the market is &gt; Timing the market.\n\n5.learn limit orders.

I now plan to finish the remaining ones on Binance US, Kraken, and others. Just because I feature a project does not mean I like it.

Bought My First ETH at $2. Finally Fully Out of the Game.,"I sold out my remaining crypto last night. Still feels surreal to me. Started buying Ethereum at just above $2 in early 2016 after missing the boat on Bitcoin. I put my whole tax return in in 2016 and threw a couple hundred at it whenever I could. I didn't buy a car and biked to work to save money. I remember at the time thinking there was about a 1/3 chance it would 100x, so there was an asymmetrical risk/reward in my opinion. \n\nSold a large chunk during the previous bull run in 2017, and sold the remaining in multiple sales this January. Averaged about a 150x on my cost basis across all sales. All long-term capital gains. Now I'm 27 and financially independent. Will be buying my parents a house this year.\n\nI love this community and hope both the technology and price continues to improve.

What to expect in the near future.,"*Original Post for bscgemsinsider on telegram*\nIMPORTANT READ\nYesterdays dip was a cause of market manipulation. Many whales were holding BTC leverage trades at a liquidation price of $38k because that seemed like a strong support level. Other whales and large traders caught wind of this and took the opportunity to pull out and dump BTC below $38k which caused billions of dollars to be liquidated, dropping the price further. The best thing to do in this scenario is understand that the crypto fundamentals have not changed and there is no reason to sell during the dip. That being said, we are on an uptrend once again BUT theres a good chance this could be a fake out and we could have another dip before we go parabolic. The best thing to do in this scenario is to find a support level of the cryptos you are holding and set a stoploss just below that. If it hits the stoploss, simply wait until the dip bottoms out then buy back in again for a discount. We are not in a bear market. There's still plenty of growth left in the long run.

Breaking the negative feedback loop,"Hi everyone. I'm fairly new to buying crypto, but nonetheless it seems like I have been picking up on some patterns at least already.\n\nOne of those things I'm noticing now, is that when the prices dip like they do now, there's a lot of FUD, often caused by the people buying crypto themselves. Which creates this negative feedback loop and prices go down even more. For example, people love bringing up the previous crash of prices, while in reality it seems like a whole different situation to me this time around.\n\nSo my point of this post, is to propose that we try and break this negative feedback loop and focus on the positive things, such that we can really see this price dip as nothing more than a dip. We should spread the news about how we shattered new records in this last period and I propose to really focus on the main ideas behind these decentralized currencies (or even decentralized computing platforms).\n\nWe should spread the news about why they matter and what good they can bring to the world. I for example really believe in this technology, mostly because of the potential of having decentralized applications in a way we have not seen before. This is also why I strongly believe that crypto's will bounce back up, I don't know when, but I think it will happen. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, let's spread some positivity, no just around here, but anywhere we can. In general the sentiment around crypto has only improved, let's keep improving it.","breaking the negative feedback loop hi everyone. i'm fairly new to buying crypto, but nonetheless it seems like i have been picking up on some patterns at least already.\n\none of those things i'm noticing now, is that when the prices dip like they do now, there is a lot of fud, often caused by the people buying crypto themselves. which creates this negative feedback loop and prices go down even more. for example, people love bringing up the previous crash of prices, while in reality it seems like a whole different situation to me this time around.\n\nso my point of this post, is to propose that we try and break this negative feedback loop and focus on the positive things, such that we can really see this price dip as nothing more than a dip. we should spread the news about how we shattered new records in this last period and i propose to really focus on the main ideas behind these decentralized currencies (or even decentralized computing platforms).\n\nwe should spread the news about why they matter and what good they can bring to the world. i for example really believe in this technology, mostly because of the potential of having decentralized applications in a way we have not seen before. this is also why i strongly believe that crypto is will bounce back up, i don't know when, but i think it will happen. \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nanyway, let is spread some positivity, no just around here, but anywhere we can. in general the sentiment around crypto has only improved, let is keep improving it.",2,2,,

A's for My Q's!,"I have been lurking on this sub and several others before entering back into the crypto pool. After doing, what I assume was not enough DD, I landed on XRP for reasons most would agree with. Love the tech, growth, etc... I decided to make my first purchase on Uphold. Did some more research, seems the fees were a bit High, but as I am in the US I have limitations to which exchange I am able to use. Decided to do a test buy  100$ of XRP @. 88 before dropping anything too serious. When I placed my transaction; however, Uphold informed me XRP has risen to over a 1$ and executed my sale at that price... I previously read the jargon about price variance due to volatility, I assumed it would fluctuate to .89, .90, or hell even .92, but that's a 60% price jump. I rushed to the market, to see what the price was figuring it had gone back over a $1. Nope, literally the same price as when I hit buy.\n\nI'm kinda at a loss here. I definitely want to buy more because I believe in the project, but clearly that jump in price negates my attempt at buying in low. Before trying Uphold I did make the investment in a cold-wallet as I plan to hodl long term. After setting up on the global exchange, however, I ran into the wall of funding my wallet. I realise I'm definitely missing a piece to to this puzzle to make it more affordable or easier. Any help or clarification would be greatly appreciated. Furthermore, any outside research material is always welcome as I am here to learn.

"Has anyone had problems with coinbase or pro, particularly the inflated shiba price yesterday and earlier today?","It was up like 600% or something then it crashed at 1pm est.  did anyone get burned?  Was anyone able to deposit and catch the high?  Just wondering, been following the price trend and comments on Webull.  Thought it was a little shiesty that people couldnâ€™t deposit and sell, like coinbase was selling something 600% higher than market price expecting the dip and knowingly screwing people over who bought into it.  My experience with coinbase is that they are shiesters.  Case in point, I bought 2 etc coins when it was low for $38 each or so I thought.  Transaction showed completed in less than a minute, $38 and small change, 2 coins.  Etc went up to $43 in a matter of an hour or so, so I thought great, I made $10 bucks.  Imagine my surprise when I looked at my coinbase account for etc and it showed 1.8â€¦ etc purchased at $40~ in my account.  I was hot.  I messaged coinbase support, and got a response 2 weeks later that the coins were bought with a set dollar amount at market value.  I replied to them that this wasnâ€™t true because I selected to buy 2 coins, not a set dollar amount, and the confirmation screen reflected this, AND I had an email saying the same thing, AND the transaction showed completed.  They replied that they can only buy what you give them money for, so too bad so sad.  I replied that if the transaction is not completed, it should not show as being completed and they should warn you that the amount you buy may not be the amount you receive.  Their reply was they would forward it to their technical team but the correct exchange rate and price spread were applied.  In contrast, when I use Crypto.com, any time I have purchased a set amount of coins, I always receive that amount of coins for the quoted price.

All the posts in one post,"DYOR, and this is not financial advice, but this correction is just a crashing dip. Now's your chance to buy your favourite coin at a discounted price before the whales dump it back on you.

I finally got meme coins today,"I have been through a couple of bull/bear cycles of crypto, but I never really understood meme coins.

(Tesla's PE is higher fyi).\n\nI would be the first one to tell you that you shouldn't put any money behind meme coins because have no utility and are mostly scams. Sure somebody got rich, but they did off of you.\n\nWhile I still stand by those  statements, something clicked for me a few days ago. While I can't say that I have been touched by gospel of the Doge, it all started to make sense.\n\nMeme coins take advantage of a bug in human nature that makes us want to join a team and be tribal. Crypto is full of all of these nonsensical flame wars about whose coin is better.  ETH vs. Cardano, BTC vs. XRP. Y coin will Kill X because of some weak rationalization that sounds like good analysis. \n\nMeme coins, turn this whole thing on its head. If imagine that ETH vs. Cardano is 50% tribal hope and 50% rational, meme coins are 100% tribal hope. They are a big fuck you to the whole irrational rationality that is crypto. For example, nobody really knows whether Solana will overtake ETH, and even if it does that doesn't mean that the price of Solana (or Cardano or Tezos or whatever) will ever  approach ETH. Yet, many of us make that assumption all day while shilling our favorite projects. If we could only just get that one justification, that one little fact that will prove that our coin is better than the others will see the truth and we win.\n\nMeme coins are the Donal Trump to Ethereum's Hillary Clinton. They are Rick James stomping his muddy boots on the white suede sofa that is Eddy Murphy's Bitcoin. \n\nMeme coins are the ultimate Chad.\n\nChad doesn't care about your adoption numbers.

Some of these solutions are based on tokenization, some are not. This lends itself as an argument against BTC being a global payment medium. \n\nThose are my main concerns.

My Crypto Journey - A Tale for Newbies Coming Into the Market,"  \n\nI just wanted to share my crypto story as there are a lot of new people coming into the space. There is an overall perception of becoming overnight millionaires but that simply, isnâ€™t likely the case. I got in in 2017 and got into a few alts.  I bought these by trading bitcoin on Bitfinex. I got the bitcoin by finding sellers on Craigslist and paying cash. It was a far more difficult time to use crypto.\n\nAs the alts pumped my meager portfolio grew beyond my wildest dreams. Still not enough to buy a house (my goal for getting in was to acquire a down payment). I figured if it went up this fast imagine what the next few months would bring. Down payment?! Iâ€™ll pay cash! Well, thatâ€™s not what happened. The market crashed hard and my portfolio deflated significantly. I had options; sell and be done with this, hold and hope it comes back or learn about it and keep buying. I chose the latter.\n\nOver the next few years, I put what little I could into buying mostly BTC and ETH stacking my portfolio. This took shear faith as it was far away from all-time highs. Everyone doubted it was even real money or worthwhile. So many people said Iâ€™m dumping real money into fake money.\n\nWell as everyone knows the market has come back as part of the 4-year havening cycle I had read about. Iâ€™ve been able to build a portfolio that grants me passive income. I use a lot of different crypto products and have built a little financial system that works well for me and I can only see this growing over time.  I am using profits to attend graduate school and recently bought a new (an old and cheap BMW) car when my car died. I didnâ€™t have to ask anyone for financial help to achieve these costly goals.\n\nSo by sticking with it Iâ€™m earning a passive income, seriously upgrading my education and was even able to buy a car when I desperately needed to. Stick with it for at least a cycle, buy good solid projects, take profits into stable coins when you can and HODL! There will be another correction in the future but when and how low is impossible to tell.\n\nTLDR: â€œFake moneyâ€ has gotten me a passive income, a real education, and a car. Stick with it â€“ there will be a lot of ups and downs.","my crypto journey - a tale for newbies coming into the market \n\ni just wanted to share my crypto story as there are a lot of new people coming into the space. there is an overall perception of becoming overnight millionaires but that simply, isnâ€™t likely the case. i got in in 2017 and got into a few alts. i bought these by trading bitcoin on bitfinex. i got the bitcoin by finding sellers on craigslist and paying cash. it was a far more difficult time to use crypto.\n\nas the alts pumped my meager portfolio grew beyond my wildest dreams. still not enough to buy a house (my goal for getting in was to acquire a down payment). i figured if it went up this fast imagine what the next few months would bring. down payment?! iâ€™ll pay cash! well, thatâ€™s not what happened. the market crashed hard and my portfolio deflated significantly. i had options; sell and be done with this, hold and hope it comes back or learn about it and keep buying. i chose the latter.\n\nover the next few years, i put what little i could into buying mostly btc and eth stacking my portfolio. this took shear faith as it was far away from all-time highs. everyone doubted it was even real money or worthwhile. so many people said iâ€™m dumping real money into fake money.\n\nwell as everyone knows the market has come back as part of the 4-year havening cycle i had read about. iâ€™ve been able to build a portfolio that grants me passive income. i use a lot of different crypto products and have built a little financial system that works well for me and i can only see this growing over time. i am using profits to attend graduate school and recently bought a new (an old and cheap bmw) car when my car died. i didnâ€™t have to ask anyone for financial help to achieve these costly goals.\n\nso by sticking with it iâ€™m earning a passive income, seriously upgrading my education and was even able to buy a car when i desperately needed to. stick with it for at least a cycle, buy good solid projects, take profits into stable coins when you can and hodl! there will be another correction in the future but when and how low is impossible to tell.\n\ntldr: â€œfake moneyâ€ has gotten me a passive income, a real education, and a car. stick with it â€“ there will be a lot of ups and downs.",2,1,,

Unpopular opinion: Keeping crypto on a trustworthy exchange is fine,"I see all these people saying ""not your keys, not your coins"" and making such a big deal about how keeping your crypto on exchanges is the worst thing ever. Yes, because I'm willing to pay a 60$ transfer fee to move my Bitcoin onto some wallet where I pose a risk of losing my keys (like many people you've heard of on news stories). Keyword is TRUSTWORTHY exchange. Obviously don't keep your crypto on some shoddy exchange which will most likely exit scam in 3 months. But if you keep your crypto on an exchange like Coinbase Pro or Kraken, you are fine. Coinbase insures your crypto unto a certain amount (which 99% of the times is more than enough to cover your whole portfolio). Also, Coinbase/Kraken have world-class engineers working on it so it's not some 2014 shit exchange like Mt. Gox. Crypto has evolved a lot from those times. Coinbase is literally a public company subject to certain regulations. The odds of Coinbase or Kraken getting compromised (and not insured) is much lower than the chance of you losing your keys.","unpopular opinion: keeping crypto on a trustworthy exchange is fine i see all these people saying ""not your keys, not your coins"" and making such a big deal about how keeping your crypto on exchanges is the worst thing ever. yes, because i'm willing to pay a 60$ transfer fee to move my bitcoin onto some wallet where i pose a risk of losing my keys (like many people you've heard of on news stories). keyword is trustworthy exchange. obviously don't keep your crypto on some shoddy exchange which will most likely exit scam in 3 months. but if you keep your crypto on an exchange like coinbase pro or kraken, you are fine. coinbase insures your crypto unto a certain amount (which 99% of the times is more than enough to cover your whole portfolio). also, coinbase/kraken have world-class engineers working on it so it is not some 2014 shit exchange like mt. gox. crypto has evolved a lot from those times. coinbase is literally a public company subject to certain regulations. the odds of coinbase or kraken getting compromised (and not insured) is much lower than the chance of you losing your keys.",2,1,,

Everyone was a crypto noob at some point in their life. A lot of people invest based on FOMO and do very little research before their first purchase. That's why shitcoins are pumping like crazy. It's just like ICO craze back in 2017/2018.,"People on this sub keep hating on different groups of people when they make money while investing in shitcons. But the problem is that not everyone is following this sub or general crypto news. A lot of people just throw money into crypto without thinking twice.\n\nI remember when I bought my first crypto few years back, you know where I got it from? From some random Google ad that displayed in my browser. No idea how crypto ad targeted me in particular. I've never had any interest in crypto prior to that. That ad then took me to eToro website I think? I couldn't register with them for some reason so after short Google search (after I got intrigued about the whole thing) I've found Coinbase. With no research at all I bought my first coins just because they were available on Coinbase. \n\nSame things happen with shitcoins. People see an ad. They probably download some crypto app. See that popular, flavour of the month shitcoin pumping like crazy and they just ape in. And let's be honest, everyone was a crypto noob at some point, that's just human nature. \n\nPeople also laughed that some folks fell for the squid coin scam, but I bet 95% of people who bought it had no idea it was a scam. Let's be real here. ""New money"" is flowing into the market now and the cycle will repeat itself again and again because people are greedy. That's why those shitcoins pump like crazy. It's mostly due to hype and marketing. It's very similar to ICO crazy back in 2017, back then people would just ape into any project that look even slightly interesting. 90% of them turned out to be scams. It's the same thing now,\n\nDo a little exercise and try remembering your first encounter with crypto and please share it here. I can tell you now that when I bought my first coins back in 2017 I was a damn noob and my experience was embarrassing to say the least. I've made many mistakes. But I am here now, more experienced. Made some decent gains over the years. A lot of those people who invest in shitcoins will also stay and sick around for longer.

For those saying weâ€™re only in it for the gains and that we donâ€™t actually believe in the tech.,"Hereâ€™s the thing. Weâ€™re all investors here. Whether youâ€™re investing the fifty bucks you earned on Coinbase or if you have a much larger stake in the game, almost all of us are hoping to see life changing gains, and thatâ€™s okay.\n\nBrowsing the subreddit Iâ€™ve noticed thereâ€™s definitely some negative Nancies out there  hating on people hoping to see more institutional adoption and real-world uses of the technology. They say that weâ€™re only in it for the gains and we donâ€™t actually care about anything else once we can get enough FIAT from our crypto holdings.\n\nThe thing is though, adoption and FIAT gains go hand-in-hand. I would say that the majority of us (especially you lurkers out there) are savvy investors. Bad investors see big green dildos and FOMO in at the top then sell at the bottom of â€œthe next big thingâ€ whether thatâ€™s GME or Doge. Good investors have researched the technology or whatever it is that theyâ€™re investing in. Even if they donâ€™t know for sure it will change the world, they understand the technology and that the projects being worked on absolutely have the potential to. If we didnâ€™t believe in the technology, then we wouldnâ€™t be willing to risk our hard-earned cash.\n\nSo yes, right now I believe most of us plan to sell most of our crypto someday for a life-changing sum of FIAT, but in order to get there we also understand that crypto needs to continue changing the world.

Forget about your crypto,"In 2018 I was a paper-handed bitch. I â€œcaught a falling knifeâ€, buying up BTC and various altcoins. Crypto became an addiction; I would research different projects for several hours every day. \n\nIn those days there wasnâ€™t as much liquidity, so before long I had more wallets/ exchange accounts than I could keep track of. I messed around with trading bots, and ended up using a strategy that DCAâ€™d my entire balance of Bitcoin into a few shitcoins. I watched the value of my portfolio plummet 90%+. \n\nLife happened and I had started a high-stress career and I lost all interest in crypto. Fast forward to May of 2020. I had a little BTC left and I converted what I thought was all my remaining crypto into BTC. I sent the whole amount to an online poker site to play some Texas Holdâ€™em. (Iâ€™m decent but also a degenerate gambler). I ran it up to 250% of its value within an hour; and then proceeded to lose it all back the next hour. I get stupid levels of greedy. \n\nAfter all this, I was sure I didnâ€™t have any crypto left. Fast forward to this year, I regained interest a couple months ago. I started up the trading bot again with much more conservative settings. Iâ€™ve been buying a little here and there to hold.\n\nToday I had the idea to check on some wallets I hadnâ€™t touched in over 3 years. I found my private keys written down deep within the recesses of my filing cabinet. I fired up the olâ€™ Metamask and what did I findâ€¦ a balance of Nexo tokens I had completely forgotten about. They had gained around 800%, and briefly were up 2000% back in May. \n\nMy lizard brain immediately thought of transferring them and either selling or trying to do something else with them, but I paused and will just leave them be.

How is Chainlink still in the top 10? Investors beware of this overpriced coin.,"I'm actually more qualified to talk about this than most redditors. I'm employed with a cyber-techno machinations company, I do a lot of security analyst programming type work. Open source, decentralized, APIs, partnerships, you name it. We'd be one of the first companies in line for something like Chainlink, if the decentralized smart contract space had more value over traditional data exchanges. There's a catch though, an underlying flaw more deeply embedded in the bedrock of LINK than the very code itself. The flaw is with the concept, and it's this: Companies won't actually go through the hassle of trusting their data API's through crypto.\n\nNow I can already hear your keyboards going frantic, but hear me out. /biz/ hates banks, and traditional data providers. But actual companies, businesses, and investors do not. There's an old saying you might have heard of: ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it!"". The idea that any of our bosses would give us the go ahead if we approached them to put our companies valuable data in a smart contract on a cryptocurrency called Chainlink, that they've never heard of, we'd be laughed out at best and fired on the spot at worst. We already have API data buyers and providers we trust.\n\n'But Chainlink is trustless!' I hear you cry, but is that really a good thing? Just listen to the sound of it. Businesses don't want to spend millions of dollars on something that is trustLESS, they want something trustFUL. 'But the reputation system!', doesn't that defeat the whole point of your coin? If companies only trust nodes with high reputation, what's the difference between trusting banks and data providers that already have reputation, but in real life not on a computer screen.\n\nThe fact is, LINK is going to share the same fate as ETH will. A lot of 'real world application' hype, with a lot of 'crypto world application' reality. Only, this billion supply coin isn't going to come close to the $1k that Etherum hit. Happy gambling though anons.\n\nIn fact, Chainlink is the epitome of a multi-level and intelligent scam. There are only three or four people on the team, who have some of the most unimpressive resumes in the blockchain field. Their Testnet consisted of nothing more than a simple JSON Parser, something that any college freshman could put together over a weekend. Remember all of those ""projects"" during late 2017 that ended up being nothing more than vaporware? Chainlink is one of them. Somehow they've survived for two years, but I think that's due to the different approach they have taken. Instead of hyping their coin, they've stayed extremely patient. They know that they can make more money from you over the course of a few years rather than weeks. I would be very cautious if you decided to buy Chainlink, as it could very well be the worst decision you've ever made. The CEO of SmartContract (Sergey Nazarov), the founder of Chainlink, holds a degree in Sociology and a minor in Religious Studies. He's also worn the same shirt at every single conference for the past two years. Is that really someone you want to trust with your money? Don't fall for all of the technical terms used in this talk. Those words mean nothing. The people in the crowd don't even know what he's talking about. The Blockchain Team Leader at Microsoft, Chad O'fork, said this about Chainlink in February 2018: ""While Smartcontract and Chainlink are interesting projects, I doubt there would be any real use-case in the future for such technology. Companies do not like to put their data in the hands of anonymous node operators.""\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Chainlink is worthless and built off hype and memes, way overpriced.","how is chainlink still in the top 10? investors beware of this overpriced coin. i'm actually more qualified to talk about this than most redditors. i'm employed with a cyber-techno machinations company, i do a lot of security analyst programming type work. open source, decentralized, apis, partnerships, you name it. we'd be one of the first companies in line for something like chainlink, if the decentralized smart contract space had more value over traditional data exchanges. there is a catch though, an underlying flaw more deeply embedded in the bedrock of link than the very code itself. the flaw is with the concept, and it is this: companies won't actually go through the hassle of trusting their data api is through crypto.\n\nnow i can already hear your keyboards going frantic, but hear me out. /biz/ hates banks, and traditional data providers. but actual companies, businesses, and investors do not. there is an old saying you might have heard of: ""if it are not broke, don't fix it!"". the idea that any of our bosses would give us the go ahead if we approached them to put our companies valuable data in a smart contract on a cryptocurrency called chainlink, that they've never heard of, we'd be laughed out at best and fired on the spot at worst. we already have api data buyers and providers we trust.\n\n'but chainlink is trustless!' i hear you cry, but is that really a good thing? just listen to the sound of it. businesses don't want to spend millions of dollars on something that is trustless, they want something trustful.

Amidst the backlash around Kickstarter â€“ why do you think people hate Blockchain technology?,"For those not caught up, Kickstarter [announced last year](https://www.kickstarter.com/articles/the-future-of-crowdfunding-creative-projects) that it was moving its business onto the blockchain, notably onto (carbon negative) Celo. The outcry was swift and fierce. And in the past few days â€“ in the midst of kickstarter creators and backers pledging to leave the service â€“ they've pumped the brakes on the project, choosing not to release their white paper, and pushing the project back into the 'research and analysis' phase. \n\nI'm curious what people think here â€“ the obvious rallying cry from critics is that 'Crypto is killing the planet!' â€“ which is a classic case of the general notion that, **nothing or no one is a monolith** (yes, bitcoin uses tons of energy, and yes, we have a solve for that in PoS). Though critics, who we can infer consist at least substantially of woke progressives, and who should innately understand this principle, reek of ignorance. \n\nBut there's something deeper. These are the same people that laugh at NFT's and think the whole system consists of miscreants and dupes.  Sure, that exists, but there is so much freakin amazing stuff happening in this space â€“Â and ironically a lot of what is taking place is completely aligned with the progressive agenda. \n\nOne huge misstep imo that kickstarter didn't do, which they should have, was with this announcement, also announce a DAO. If done with the proper education, backers and project owners would see that with this change they'd have greater control over the service, that they could actually be able to now make decisions to shape the future of what Kickstarter will be, all thanks to blockchain technology. This is a perfect use-case, which puts the power in the hands of the  community (something web2 has never done) â€“Â how is that not progress? how does that not appeal to the progressive agenda?  \n\nWith that said â€“ the thing I'm wondering is whether ultimately that's what it is, that the critics think that it in some capacity the blockchain is this shrouded entity that removes their power, their agency, their voice â€“â€“ when the reality couldn't be further from the truth. Sure, anonymity is a thing atm, and that may help breed the misconception, but c'mon, how do they not see that when everything is on a public ledger, the people now have way more power, more transparency and can hold accountable the powers that be. \n\nSo curious to hear people's thoughts?","amidst the backlash around kickstarter â€“ why do you think people hate blockchain technology? for those not caught up, kickstarter [announced last year]( that it was moving its business onto the blockchain, notably onto (carbon negative) celo. the outcry was swift and fierce. and in the past few days â€“ in the midst of kickstarter creators and backers pledging to leave the service â€“ they've pumped the brakes on the project, choosing not to release their white paper, and pushing the project back into the 'research and analysis' phase. \n\ni'm curious what people think here â€“ the obvious rallying cry from critics is that 'crypto is killing the planet!' â€“ which is a classic case of the general notion that, **nothing or no one is a monolith** (yes, bitcoin uses tons of energy, and yes, we have a solve for that in pos). though critics, who we can infer consist at least substantially of woke progressives, and who should innately understand this principle, reek of ignorance. \n\nbut there is something deeper. these are the same people that laugh at nft is and think the whole system consists of miscreants and dupes. sure, that exists, but there is so much freakin amazing stuff happening in this space â€“Â and ironically a lot of what is taking place is completely aligned with the progressive agenda. \n\none huge misstep imo that kickstarter didn't do, which they should have, was with this announcement, also announce a dao. if done with the proper education, backers and project owners would see that with this change they'd have greater control over the service, that they could actually be able to now make decisions to shape the future of what kickstarter will be, all thanks to blockchain technology. this is a perfect use-case, which puts the power in the hands of the community (something web2 has never done) â€“Â how is that not progress? how does that not appeal to the progressive agenda? \n\nwith that said â€“ the thing i'm wondering is whether ultimately that is what it is, that the critics think that it in some capacity the blockchain is this shrouded entity that removes their power, their agency, their voice â€“â€“ when the reality couldn't be further from the truth. sure, anonymity is a thing atm, and that may help breed the misconception, but c'mon, how do they not see that when everything is on a public ledger, the people now have way more power, more transparency and can hold accountable the powers that be. \n\nso curious to hear people is thoughts?",2,1,,
"The two things holding back crypto prices right now: 1. Over-leverage, 2. Unrealistic expectations","So people keep wondering ""Wen lambo?"" At this rate? Maybe never.\n\nThe majority of the reason we expect crypto prices to increase exponentially over time is because of increased demand meeting increasing scarcity. Prices will go up because of one or the other, but it takes both to increase exponentially.\n\n**1. Over-leverage.** The get-rich quick crowd. If you're a big player who wants to buy a whole lot of crypto without paying a whole lot of money, how do you do it? You find the over-leveraged folks, liquidate them, and then buy up all their coins. Over-leveraged long? Let's short the market a little and see what shakes out. Over-leveraged shorts? Let's bid up the price juuuuust enough to liquidate them and then buy up all THEIR coins too as the increased supply drops prices back down.\n\nAs long as there are enough people who are just begging to be liquidated by over-leveraging, you never have to bid up the price to buy those next 1,000 BTC. People are lining up to give them to you at or relatively near the current price. All you have to do is just be patient and wait.\n\n**2. Unrealistic expectations.** When you look at the current coins being sold today, the majority of them have been bought within the last three to six months. Analytics show that HODLers are still HODLing. It's not them selling. It's the FOMO crowd for the most part which is giving up these coins after a couple of months. So they either bought it with a super short time horizon and unrealistically expecting it to moon immediately, or they intended to hold it long term but invested more than they could afford with the unrealistic expectation that it would moon immediately. Either way, they're providing a steady flow of crypto into whale hands.\n\nSo long as we have enough people from these two categories to keep supplying people with cheap crypto, that's all we're likely to ever have: cheap crypto.","the two things holding back crypto prices right now: 1. over-leverage, 2. unrealistic expectations so people keep wondering ""wen lambo?"" at this rate? maybe never.\n\nthe majority of the reason we expect crypto prices to increase exponentially over time is because of increased demand meeting increasing scarcity. prices will go up because of one or the other, but it takes both to increase exponentially.\n\n**1. over-leverage.** the get-rich quick crowd. if you're a big player who wants to buy a whole lot of crypto without paying a whole lot of money, how do you do it? you find the over-leveraged folks, liquidate them, and then buy up all their coins. over-leveraged long? let is short the market a little and see what shakes out. over-leveraged shorts? let is bid up the price juuuuust enough to liquidate them and then buy up all their coins too as the increased supply drops prices back down.\n\nas long as there are enough people who are just begging to be liquidated by over-leveraging, you never have to bid up the price to buy those next 1,000 btc. people are lining up to give them to you at or relatively near the current price. all you have to do is just be patient and wait.\n\n**2. unrealistic expectations.** when you look at the current coins being sold today, the majority of them have been bought within the last three to six months. analytics show that hodlers are still hodling. it is not them selling. it is the fomo crowd for the most part which is giving up these coins after a couple of months. so they either bought it with a super short time horizon and unrealistically expecting it to moon immediately, or they intended to hold it long term but invested more than they could afford with the unrealistic expectation that it would moon immediately. either way, they're providing a steady flow of crypto into whale hands.\n\nso long as we have enough people from these two categories to keep supplying people with cheap crypto, that is all we're likely to ever have: cheap crypto.",2,1,,

Timing the market newbie confession,"I would like to share my experience with everyone here, considering the recent dump/consolidation/correction.\n\nAs many new people here, January/February with GME/Dogecoin was everywhere,  it intrigued me also. I bought a few hundred $ of Doge and parallelly start to explore other altcoins. As I was reading more and more, mainly in r/cc sub, I realized Doge is shit, and there other great projects with real business/development value. I sold my Doge, and bought some XRP, ADA, VET, ONE. As I was continued to explore, I was buying more coins. Later on, bought some LTO as it looked really promising, and ETH also. I didn't buy any BTC, the return will be small I was thinking, and the best is to earn on alts and then transfer earnings into BTC.  I made some really quick gains and started to sell my coins as I was thinking to buy them again when they drop.  I managed some of them to buy at the lower price, but some of them I bought at the higher price later, as the FOMO kicked in. Little by little, I was trying to time the market. Waiting for a dip, it sometimes comes, other times it doesn't. Last week, while going through my transactions, I saw that I bought ONE for 0.07, VET at 0.04, LTO 0.3, ETH 1200. If I only held it until today, without ever checking charts, my return will be around 8 times larger than are now. 8 fcking times.\n\nThe amount of time I invested in learning technical analysis, is well spent, as I really love to learn new things and it will be quite useful for future investment. But I was talking about the amount of time I spent trying to predict dip or correction, I could smarter invest in mining more fiat and only buying more coins and hold them. My point here is, don't try to time the market, sometimes you will win, sometimes you will lose (If you are not really experienced/knowledgeable, you will lose more). Learn from my mistakes, my example, because in my case, by being in the market for only three months, and simply holding what I bought at the begging could give me 8X more return right now. Now imagine what can you accomplish with more time in the market, because we are still early in this, trust me with that, people from the small town I live still don't know what crypto is, I dare to say 5% heard of it, but less than 1% invested in it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR:\n\nDon't try to time the market, buy any amount you can and hold. If I only held, for three short months I am in market, I would easily 8x the money I made trying to buy the dip, sell - time the market.","timing the market newbie confession i would like to share my experience with everyone here, considering the recent dump/consolidation/correction.\n\nas many new people here, january/february with gme/dogecoin was everywhere, it intrigued me also. i bought a few hundred $ of doge and parallelly start to explore other altcoins. as i was reading more and more, mainly in r/cc sub, i realized doge is shit, and there other great projects with real business/development value. i sold my doge, and bought some xrp, ada, vet, one. as i was continued to explore, i was buying more coins. later on, bought some lto as it looked really promising, and eth also. i didn't buy any btc, the return will be small i was thinking, and the best is to earn on alts and then transfer earnings into btc. i made some really quick gains and started to sell my coins as i was thinking to buy them again when they drop. i managed some of them to buy at the lower price, but some of them i bought at the higher price later, as the fomo kicked in. little by little, i was trying to time the market. waiting for a dip, it sometimes comes, other times it doesn't. last week, while going through my transactions, i saw that i bought one for 0.07, vet at 0.04, lto 0.3, eth 1200. if i only held it until today, without ever checking charts, my return will be around 8 times larger than are now. 8 fcking times.\n\nthe amount of time i invested in learning technical analysis, is well spent, as i really love to learn new things and it will be quite useful for future investment. but i was talking about the amount of time i spent trying to predict dip or correction, i could smarter invest in mining more fiat and only buying more coins and hold them. my point here is, don't try to time the market, sometimes you will win, sometimes you will lose (if you are not really experienced/knowledgeable, you will lose more). learn from my mistakes, my example, because in my case, by being in the market for only three months, and simply holding what i bought at the begging could give me 8x more return right now. now imagine what can you accomplish with more time in the market, because we are still early in this, trust me with that, people from the small town i live still don't know what crypto is, i dare to say 5% heard of it, but less than 1% invested in it. \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\ntldr:\n\ndon't try to time the market, buy any amount you can and hold. if i only held, for three short months i am in market, i would easily 8x the money i made trying to buy the dip, sell - time the market.",2,1,,

Over the course of a year and half, it amounted to roughly 150 usd. Yesterday I saw TERRALUNA going from $10 and further down the hill so I, for the first time ever, decided to use KuCoins 3S coin. So in short a 3x short trading option. Everything went fine and slowly it got to value of roughly usd 250 and I was super excited. I could take the position and cash out and get kids something. It kept going down and my position gaining valueâ€¦all until KuCoin decided to literally close my investment and block me from all withdrawal. Now Im stuck with their 31 L3S coins which are valued at a few centsâ€¦\n\nAs Iâ€™m not from US this might not sound like a big loss for a lot of people from first world countries but as an only parent who was building this portfolio for over a yearâ€¦it really crushed me.\n\nIâ€™m posting this so that you donâ€™t make the same mistake! KuCoin is a casino both in features and in getting your money back. They donâ€™t care. And donâ€™t even think of fiddling with their 3 short or long coins. These are literally scam and should be forbidden. I was always against regulations in crypto but stuff like this should be an offense.\n\nDont be like me.","kucoin literally stole all my savings that took me year and half to save and now refuses to do anything about itâ€¦ there were so many people on reddit telling me not to use kucoin but i went against them and thought itâ€™ll be fine. well it wasnâ€™t, not at all. \n\niâ€™ve been steadily putting small change that i was able to â€œafford to loseâ€ into algo, eth, btc and trac on kucoin. over the course of a year and half, it amounted to roughly 150 usd. yesterday i saw terraluna going from $10 and further down the hill so i, for the first time ever, decided to use kucoins 3s coin. so in short a 3x short trading option. everything went fine and slowly it got to value of roughly usd 250 and i was super excited. i could take the position and cash out and get kids something. it kept going down and my position gaining valueâ€¦all until kucoin decided to literally close my investment and block me from all withdrawal. now im stuck with their 31 l3s coins which are valued at a few centsâ€¦\n\nas iâ€™m not from us this might not sound like a big loss for a lot of people from first world countries but as an only parent who was building this portfolio for over a yearâ€¦it really crushed me.\n\niâ€™m posting this so that you donâ€™t make the same mistake! kucoin is a casino both in features and in getting your money back. they donâ€™t care. and donâ€™t even think of fiddling with their 3 short or long coins. these are literally scam and should be forbidden. i was always against regulations in crypto but stuff like this should be an offense.\n\ndont be like me.",2,1,,

The biggest barrier to adoption is greed.,"You read the title, so do allow me to elaborate. I've been active on this sub for a while now. I've been lurking for much longer. I've amassed a wealth of knowledge, and I can't thank this community enough for that. However. I've noticed a pattern.\n\nCertain members on this subreddit tend to be rather contradictory in their values. Collectively, we all agree that adoption is important to take cryptocurrency mainstream. This theoretically benefits us all. We loath large institutions and governments that seek to unnecessarily suppress cryptocurrency through arbitrary regulation and FUD, thereby hindering it's growth and adoption.\n\nWhat is ironic is. A large number of members of this sub (not all) tend to be very greedy in facilitating this adoption. How? It mainly comes in two ways. Mistreatment and misinformation to newcomers, and the absolutely cynical harassment and downvoting of legitimately good information. Mostly for personal gain, as there is a false connotation that good information may attract up votes, which equate to more Moons, and downvoting this information may increase the downvoter's moons that they receive at distribution.\n\nI guess all of this is a long winded way of saying, we need to be more supportive of cryptocurrency and each other. If we can't do that here, in the literal premier community for cryptocurrency discussion and adoption, where can it be achieved? And how does it make us any better than greedy governments, individuals, and institutional bodies that seek to capitalise on cryptocurrency because of greed and suppress the masses?\n\nCheers guys. I'm sorry in advance for any errors in my English, it's not my first language. I hope you all had a lovely Christmas, and that both your loved ones and yourselves are healthy and safe. Don't forget to tell your loved ones that you're proud of them and that you love them too.

Did I make a newbie mistake?,I entered the crypto space in Q2 this year and got fascinated of what could be possible in the upcoming years with all this new technology. But I also experienced the May crash. I got really nervous to hold it but Iâ€™m glad I did. After the new surge of rising prices I thought I should take some profits. So I did my own research like this sub is always telling you and I loaded my bags with ALGO and AVAX. I accumulated AVAX at like $15 and staked it. Afterwards I saw the rise till 80 bucks but couldnâ€™t take the profits due to stake locking. It made me nervous so I after the lockout period I moved my AVAX to an exchange with sell order at $75 for a good 5x. But yeah now I see I could have a 10x within 3 weeks and Iâ€™m asking myself if it was dumb to sell everything instead of maybe just half of the whole stack. Is it common to only sell max 50% of your coins or what is a proper trading strategy? \n\nThanks in advance,did i make a newbie mistake? i entered the crypto space in q2 this year and got fascinated of what could be possible in the upcoming years with all this new technology. but i also experienced the may crash. i got really nervous to hold it but iâ€™m glad i did. after the new surge of rising prices i thought i should take some profits. so i did my own research like this sub is always telling you and i loaded my bags with algo and avax. i accumulated avax at like $15 and staked it. afterwards i saw the rise till 80 bucks but couldnâ€™t take the profits due to stake locking. it made me nervous so i after the lockout period i moved my avax to an exchange with sell order at $75 for a good 5x. but yeah now i see i could have a 10x within 3 weeks and iâ€™m asking myself if it was dumb to sell everything instead of maybe just half of the whole stack. is it common to only sell max 50% of your coins or what is a proper trading strategy? \n\nthanks in advance,2,1,,

Last time to get Eth under 4k! 3k! 2k! | What I learned from buying Crypto at ATHâ€™s,"I constantly see people saying how crypto right now is at a huge discount. And although I agree in regards to the future that I speculate these prices will be. Letâ€™s not be so quick to forget what the prices were just 6 months ago.\n\nAs of January 1st 2021:\n\nâ€¢ Amp: &gt;1 penny \nâ€¢ Ada: 18 cents \nâ€¢ Algo: 40 cents \nâ€¢ Link: $11.88 \nâ€¢ Eth: $730 \nâ€¢ Btc: $29,400\n\nAnd this is why you should never â€œchaseâ€ all time highs. I remember many (including myself) saying â€œlast time to get Eth under $4,000. And all though this is â€œgoodâ€ when you think of a 10k Eth, you shouldnâ€™t rule out just how high Crypto is this year.\n\nAnd I think this â€œBuy the dipâ€ mentality is pretty ridiculous. If youâ€™re going to buy crypto, buy to accumulate more at the best prices you can, but donâ€™t be too concerned that weâ€™re no where near ATHâ€™s at this current moment. \n\nCrypto is a long term game, the patient ones win out, donâ€™t expect to get rich quick and donâ€™t be distraught when youâ€™re down. However, with this information, we can be better prepared to make better decisions in the future. \n\nThis is not financial advice, but I remember someone saying in the daily once: â€œDonâ€™t sell on red days and donâ€™t buy on Green Dayâ€™sâ€ -itâ€™s simple but effective. But remember, youâ€™re not buying the dip, youâ€™re buying to accumulate for the long haul (assuming itâ€™s not a shit coin/ scam). Do your DD, DCA, donâ€™t FOMO chasing ATH, donâ€™t capitulate, and keep a grounded perspective about where we are now in comparison to where we were not even more than a year ago.\n\nI remember seeing BTC at 3k and laughing at the â€œfoolsâ€ who didnâ€™t sell at 11k. This was in 2019, as long as you believe in the future of crypto (and not your favorite rug pull shit coin) you have to assume youâ€™ll need to hodl to make a profit to reduce the risk in a volatile market. In the end I was the fool, but, no more. I hope, this may help someone learn from my mistakes.\n\nOh and lastly donâ€™t believe the 95% of the youtubers you see saying â€œ_____ will moon next!!!â€","last time to get eth under 4k! 3k! 2k! | what i learned from buying crypto at athâ€™s i constantly see people saying how crypto right now is at a huge discount. and although i agree in regards to the future that i speculate these prices will be. letâ€™s not be so quick to forget what the prices were just 6 months ago.\n\nas of january 1st 2021:\n\nâ€¢ amp: &gt;1 penny \nâ€¢ ada: 18 cents \nâ€¢ algo: 40 cents \nâ€¢ link: $11.88 \nâ€¢ eth: $730 \nâ€¢ btc: $29,400\n\nand this is why you should never â€œchaseâ€ all time highs. i remember many (including myself) saying â€œlast time to get eth under $4,000. and all though this is â€œgoodâ€ when you think of a 10k eth, you shouldnâ€™t rule out just how high crypto is this year.\n\nand i think this â€œbuy the dipâ€ mentality is pretty ridiculous. if youâ€™re going to buy crypto, buy to accumulate more at the best prices you can, but donâ€™t be too concerned that weâ€™re no where near athâ€™s at this current moment. \n\ncrypto is a long term game, the patient ones win out, donâ€™t expect to get rich quick and donâ€™t be distraught when youâ€™re down. however, with this information, we can be better prepared to make better decisions in the future. \n\nthis is not financial advice, but i remember someone saying in the daily once: â€œdonâ€™t sell on red days and donâ€™t buy on green dayâ€™sâ€ -itâ€™s simple but effective. but remember, youâ€™re not buying the dip, youâ€™re buying to accumulate for the long haul (assuming itâ€™s not a shit coin/ scam). do your dd, dca, donâ€™t fomo chasing ath, donâ€™t capitulate, and keep a grounded perspective about where we are now in comparison to where we were not even more than a year ago.\n\ni remember seeing btc at 3k and laughing at the â€œfoolsâ€ who didnâ€™t sell at 11k. this was in 2019, as long as you believe in the future of crypto (and not your favorite rug pull shit coin) you have to assume youâ€™ll need to hodl to make a profit to reduce the risk in a volatile market. in the end i was the fool, but, no more. i hope, this may help someone learn from my mistakes.\n\noh and lastly donâ€™t believe the 95% of the youtubers you see saying â€œ_____ will moon next!!!â€",2,1,,

How I stopped worrying and learned to love my crypto portfolio,"Thereâ€™s never been a better time to stop looking at your portfolio in fiat amounts, and start comparing to BTC.\n\nREQUIREMENTS (for this to make you feel better about recent prices)\n\n1.	You have to believe in bitcoin long term, and believe that while there will be big dips, it will always recover, and push higher. I believe that. If you donâ€™t, then the numbers are meaningless, and you can stop reading.\n2.	You have to only invest funds that you donâ€™t need for other purposes in the near future. If bitcoin always trends up, then eventually you will take out profits. But if you NEED that money at a specific time, whether itâ€™s in 2 months or two years, you might be screwed if that time falls during a dip.\n3.	Your portfolio should be mainly alts.\n\nI finally did a manual entry of my entire portfolio into CoinStats, so I could compare P/L using USD and BTC.\n\nOver the last 6 months, I am still up 280% in USD, and only 204% in BTC. But as I look at shorter time periods, it becomes more obvious that looking at USD paints a much more bearish (and misleading, IMO) picture.\n\nOver the last 3 months: Up only 2% in USD, but 64% in BTC.\n\nOver 1 month: Down 37% in USD, but breaking even in BTC. So, even after all this dipping, false recovery, deeper dipping, I am at roughly zero P/L for the last month, in BTC terms.\n\nCritically, at bitcoinâ€™s peak on April 13th, I was up 125% in BTC value relative to 6 months ago, and today, even with bitcoin down roughly 45% from then, I am up 200% in BTC value. In other words, my BTC value has been gaining the whole time bitcoin has been dropping.\n\nIF you donâ€™t need your funds now, and IF you are bullish on BTC long term, and you track against BTC instead of fiat, then you would never even *think* about selling *anything* with this portfolio.\n\nObviously, your mileage will vary depending on the coins you hold. If you are mostly in positions on quality alt-coins, youâ€™ll see similar results.\n\nFWIW I hold 7 coins including BTC, and no ETH, because I am hardcore bearish on ETH. If I had a large position in ETH, these numbers would look very different. If your portfolio consists of mostly ETH, BTC, or a combination of the two, this isnâ€™t going to make you feel betterâ€¦hehe.","how i stopped worrying and learned to love my crypto portfolio thereâ€™s never been a better time to stop looking at your portfolio in fiat amounts, and start comparing to btc.\n\nrequirements (for this to make you feel better about recent prices)\n\n1.	you have to believe in bitcoin long term, and believe that while there will be big dips, it will always recover, and push higher. i believe that. if you donâ€™t, then the numbers are meaningless, and you can stop reading.\n2.	you have to only invest funds that you donâ€™t need for other purposes in the near future. if bitcoin always trends up, then eventually you will take out profits. but if you need that money at a specific time, whether itâ€™s in 2 months or two years, you might be screwed if that time falls during a dip.\n3.	your portfolio should be mainly alts.\n\ni finally did a manual entry of my entire portfolio into coinstats, so i could compare p/l using usd and btc.\n\nover the last 6 months, i am still up 280% in usd, and only 204% in btc. but as i look at shorter time periods, it becomes more obvious that looking at usd paints a much more bearish (and misleading, imo) picture.\n\nover the last 3 months: up only 2% in usd, but 64% in btc.\n\nover 1 month: down 37% in usd, but breaking even in btc. so, even after all this dipping, false recovery, deeper dipping, i am at roughly zero p/l for the last month, in btc terms.\n\ncritically, at bitcoinâ€™s peak on april 13th, i was up 125% in btc value relative to 6 months ago, and today, even with bitcoin down roughly 45% from then, i am up 200% in btc value. in other words, my btc value has been gaining the whole time bitcoin has been dropping.\n\nif you donâ€™t need your funds now, and if you are bullish on btc long term, and you track against btc instead of fiat, then you would never even *think* about selling *anything* with this portfolio.\n\nobviously, your mileage will vary depending on the coins you hold. if you are mostly in positions on quality alt-coins, youâ€™ll see similar results.\n\nfwiw i hold 7 coins including btc, and no eth, because i am hardcore bearish on eth. if i had a large position in eth, these numbers would look very different. if your portfolio consists of mostly eth, btc, or a combination of the two, this isnâ€™t going to make you feel betterâ€¦hehe.",2,1,,

Using a per transaction metric to talk about bitcoin energy use is disingenuous and intellectually lazy. Here's Why:," The ""PER transaction"" carbon, electricity and e-waste metric is such a deceitful metric. Anyone who uses it is willful ignoring that:  \n\n* there are several other chains that are merge mined with the same hashpower as bitcoin (Syscoin is one of the biggest).  So does syscoin have zero carbon responsibility because it uses BTC's hash in merge mining ?  The authors of such metrics would like us to believe so.   \n\n* There are hundreds of thousand of transactions that take place on the Lightening network.  Why are the authors of these ""per transaction"" metrics willfully ignoring all the activity on the Lightening network ?  Is it because they are to lazy to actually figure out how many transactions are taking place ? Or are they trying to push an agenda.   Besides lightening network, there are other layer 2 networks, like liquid.  Where thousands of transactions take place.  \n\n* The current hashpower secures ALL PAST transactions.  The current hashpower isnt just used to write the current transactions in a block, but its used to secure every single previous transaction in bitcoins history.   \n\n* The block reward is more than just a normal transaction.\n\n The block reward can be considered as a kind of battery whereby the electricity used to make hashes is transformed into a more easily kept and stored unit.  In a way,  these newly created bitcoin can be considered as a form of stored electricity.  The electricity used to create those bitcoins gets transformed into unit of accounts.  These units then can be transformed back into electricity via purchasing power that the BTC units have.  Or even more literally, they can be used to hire mechanical work from humans or other machines (using BTC to rent a generator that produces energy, or renting a solar array to charge a battery).  So figuratively the block reward acts as a sort of battery.  The energy isn't ""wasted""  its merely transformed into units that can be more easily stored over time and sent across the planet.  \n\nThe bitcoin energy usage discussion is a very nuanced one, and it's very intellectually lazy to try to use comparisons of ""per transaction"".  Lets look at GPU gaming.  It uses more electricity than the bitcoin network, but it doesnt generate units of account that can be used forever (or as long the BTC network exists).  It just generates fun (at the time) and perhaps some fond memories.  Or take a look at x-mas trees lights (https://phys.org/news/2015-12-christmas-energy-entire-countries.html)  They can be considered not very useful in that they only provide ascetically pleasing lights for a tiny period, yet consume the amount of energy as small countries.  But again, bitcoin energy is transformed into units of account that can be used for as long as the network exists.  \n\nUsing a per tx metric to talk about bitcoin energy use is disingenuous and intellectually lazy.

What crypto taught me: Crypto made me totally numb to price drops in crypto and stocks!,"Pardon any grammer or spelling, it's 1:30 am and I'm dead tired. \n\nI used to fuss and freak out if my stock dropped 5%, I'm down \~25% on my portfolio (stonks) and I don't care. I'm numb now. If it drops, I'll buy more! I love crypto, at the least, if I get nothing from crypto, it taught me patience (a bit hard for a 17yo to think long term lol). And it taught that it doesn't matter if BTC is down 3%, 5%, 15% ect, It's still a great bet long term. I used to check my stocks every 5 minutes... Now I check them like once a week. The moral of the story, is that it doesn't matter what is happening today, what matters is long term. As long as you believe in a project (I have mine like mainly BTC and the rest in ETH, XMR, ADA, RVN, in that order). Fine a project you believe in, that you think will have good long term progress. Everyone says this, don't try to day trade, the fees will cost you. Just hold, or HODL as the saying goes. Don't go for memes like DOGE, SHITCOIN or any other random project that you can find on r/CryptoMoonShots or whatever. The best thing is DYOR, find a project (I suggest ADA, XMR, RVN and ofc ETH, BTC) and just wait. Obviously the lure of easy money is great, but remember, if it's to good to be true. It probably is.","what crypto taught me: crypto made me totally numb to price drops in crypto and stocks! pardon any grammer or spelling, it is 1:30 am and i'm dead tired. \n\ni used to fuss and freak out if my stock dropped 5%, i'm down \~25% on my portfolio (stonks) and i don't care. i'm numb now. if it drops, i'll buy more! i love crypto, at the least, if i get nothing from crypto, it taught me patience (a bit hard for a 17yo to think long term lol). and it taught that it doesn't matter if btc is down 3%, 5%, 15% ect, it is still a great bet long term. i used to check my stocks every 5 minutes... now i check them like once a week. the moral of the story, is that it doesn't matter what is happening today, what matters is long term. as long as you believe in a project (i have mine like mainly btc and the rest in eth, xmr, ada, rvn, in that order). fine a project you believe in, that you think will have good long term progress. everyone says this, don't try to day trade, the fees will cost you. just hold, or hodl as the saying goes. don't go for memes like doge, shitcoin or any other random project that you can find on r/cryptomoonshots or whatever. the best thing is dyor, find a project (i suggest ada, xmr, rvn and ofc eth, btc) and just wait. obviously the lure of easy money is great, but remember, if it is to good to be true. it probably is.",2,1,,

I spent the day running errands with her, talking to her about the musk hype, the inflation, general crypto cycles and crashes. I explained the dangers of buying the hype and effectively said crypto is a lottery ticket, when you buy it you have to see the money as spent with no reward, and to expect no reward.\n\nAfter going through all this she still wanted in on crypto but had gone off the idea of doge (thank god).

Why im extremely BEARISH about the crypto market in 2022 but still BULLISH on LRC,"I started investing in stock options in early 2020, RIGHT BEFORE THE PANDEMIC.  \nOnce the pandemic hit, I made around $60,000 on the following rally.  \nAlmost 2 years later and the market has now most definitely hit a ridiculous PEAK.  \nThe FED has announced tapering coming up VERY SOON. This will be the needle that makes everything burst. Evergrande is just a big fat bearish cherry on top.  \nElon is cashing out and so are the other big boys.  \nWhen SPY drops 20% in a few weeks time, BTC will drop 50% in a few DAYS time - that is something I believe as much as I believe in LRC becoming a top-ten coin one day.  \nPrepare yourselves for this upcoming volatility.  \nMy other ""sure thing"" holdings like VET and HBAR will most definitely lose 50%+ of their value in DAYS.  \nWith that said though, I will continue to hold LRC because we have certain historic (for the project itself) catalysts coming up that I believe will bypass the overall market dip.  \nWe might still have flash crashes of 20-50% but I am not one to time the market and risk my precious looprings. All eyes are on the project and money is just waiting to flow in.  \nPrepare yourselves for the long game, which can be 4-6 months like the last time BTC halved and the recovered but I do believe we can hit $20-50b market cap by the end of 2022 especially if the crash happens in Q1-Q2.","why im extremely bearish about the crypto market in 2022 but still bullish on lrc i started investing in stock options in early 2020, right before the pandemic. \nonce the pandemic hit, i made around $60,000 on the following rally. \nalmost 2 years later and the market has now most definitely hit a ridiculous peak. \nthe fed has announced tapering coming up very soon. this will be the needle that makes everything burst. evergrande is just a big fat bearish cherry on top. \nelon is cashing out and so are the other big boys. \nwhen spy drops 20% in a few weeks time, btc will drop 50% in a few days time - that is something i believe as much as i believe in lrc becoming a top-ten coin one day. \nprepare yourselves for this upcoming volatility. \nmy other ""sure thing"" holdings like vet and hbar will most definitely lose 50%+ of their value in days. \nwith that said though, i will continue to hold lrc because we have certain historic (for the project itself) catalysts coming up that i believe will bypass the overall market dip. \nwe might still have flash crashes of 20-50% but i am not one to time the market and risk my precious looprings. all eyes are on the project and money is just waiting to flow in. \nprepare yourselves for the long game, which can be 4-6 months like the last time btc halved and the recovered but i do believe we can hit $20-50b market cap by the end of 2022 especially if the crash happens in q1-q2.",2,1,,

I did all the proper research needed to set up a proper crypto mining operation, I even found what I thought to be a legitimate site. It was on asicminervalue.com, it had a trusted rating, and I searched it up and it even had a near 4 star rating on google. That was about all the research I did on this company. Their price for the miners were really good, but not too good to be true so everything seemed fine.

It provides a list of the top 100 subreddits a user has posted in and their most commonly used 100 words, excluding articles (the/a) and prepositions (in/on/etc.) I think. There are also graphs of their comments and submissions by date.\n\nYou can use this information to identify users who bolster their reputation in karma farming subs; potential shills who are likely to be biased in their 'advice'; trolls who are just trying to cause disruption etc etc.\n\n\nhttps://redditmetis.com/ - Is another site that analyzes a user, similar to reddit-user-analyser but in addition to displaying where and when they post and get karma it also will actually use their posts to extract information they have stated about themselves such as their employment, nationality etc. This shouldn't be taken as completely reliable as not only can it make mistakes but it also has no way of knowing if a user has lied. Some information has a # link next to it which leads you to the comment from which the information was extracted, this lets you consider context and judge it's veracity for yourself.\n\nAnother great feature of redditmetis is the activity heatmap, showing when in the day a user posts. If they claim to be from Canada but they only post in working hours Moscow time then that may raise a red flag...\n\n\nhttps://www.redditinvestigator.com/ - Similar to the first two however much slower to generate the analysis. I'd suggest giving it a try, although I use it much less than the others. The one unique feature is that it extracts the website links used in submissions to show you if the user frequently links to certain sites. In the context of crypto, if someone is constantly shilling their shitcoin you might expect to see a high frequency of links to the coin's ICO for example.\n\n\n\nhttps://camas.github.io/reddit-search/ - This site lets you search all comments a user has made on a certain sub, within a certain timeframe and/or including keywords. If you wanted to find all the posts made by account X in r/cryptocurrency that included their shillcoin Y you could do so. Similarly if someone is trying to drive down interest in a competing project you might search for terms like 'Overpriced' or 'Shitcoin' and see how often they sue those in association with their opponent.\n\nhttps://redditcommentsearch.com/ - Does similar to the above but with less search options. No fields to limit date range for example, but otherwise perfectly useful. Sometimes simplicity is good.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.reveddit.com/ and https://www.removeddit.com/ - Both of these sites allow you to view deleted comments from discussions, assuming that the comments wasn't removed too quickly. You'll often see users arguing in what appears to be bad faith, spreading disinformation about projects or lying to hype something up. When someone disproves their bullshit or calls them out the bad-faith user may delete their comments, so when they try something similar again no-one can see that they shouldn't be trusted.\n\nEither of these sites provide you with a counter to these reputation management techniques, allowing you to view and share evidence of previous manipulation attempts that the user may think they have scrubbed from the record.\n\n\nAs per the cryptocurrency mantra - **Don't trust, verify.**","spotting manipulation and resisting bad faith users. as crypto gets more popular i thought it might be useful to share some tools to help people protect themselves from bad faith posters, manipulative users and just general trolls. my interest is in upskilling people to resist this type of thing in every context, not specifically relating to crypto, but i'm hoping that here is somewhere it can actually to demonstrable good to help people protect themselves from scams and financial disinformation. feel free to share this wherever and whenever you like.\n\nhere is some sites you can use to check up on other users before deciding how much weight to give their professed opinion:\n\n - the simplest and fastest user analysis tool that i use. it provides a list of the top 100 subreddits a user has posted in and their most commonly used 100 words, excluding articles (the/a) and prepositions (in/on/etc.) i think. there are also graphs of their comments and submissions by date.\n\nyou can use this information to identify users who bolster their reputation in karma farming subs; potential shills who are likely to be biased in their 'advice'; trolls who are just trying to cause disruption etc etc.\n\n\n - is another site that analyzes a user, similar to reddit-user-analyser but in addition to displaying where and when they post and get karma it also will actually use their posts to extract information they have stated about themselves such as their employment, nationality etc. this shouldn't be taken as completely reliable as not only can it make mistakes but it also has no way of knowing if a user has lied. some information has a # link next to it which leads you to the comment from which the information was extracted, this lets you consider context and judge it is veracity for yourself.\n\nanother great feature of redditmetis is the activity heatmap, showing when in the day a user posts. if they claim to be from canada but they only post in working hours moscow time then that may raise a red flag...\n\n\n - similar to the first two however much slower to generate the analysis. i'd suggest giving it a try, although i use it much less than the others. the one unique feature is that it extracts the website links used in submissions to show you if the user frequently links to certain sites. in the context of crypto, if someone is constantly shilling their shitcoin you might expect to see a high frequency of links to the coin is ico for example.\n\n\n\n - this site lets you search all comments a user has made on a certain sub, within a certain timeframe and/or including keywords. if you wanted to find all the posts made by account x in r/cryptocurrency that included their shillcoin y you could do so. similarly if someone is trying to drive down interest in a competing project you might search for terms like 'overpriced' or 'shitcoin' and see how often they sue those in association with their opponent.\n\n - does similar to the above but with less search options. no fields to limit date range for example, but otherwise perfectly useful. sometimes simplicity is good.\n\n\n\n and  - both of these sites allow you to view deleted comments from discussions, assuming that the comments wasn't removed too quickly. you'll often see users arguing in what appears to be bad faith, spreading disinformation about projects or lying to hype something up. when someone disproves their bullshit or calls them out the bad-faith user may delete their comments, so when they try something similar again no-one can see that they shouldn't be trusted.\n\neither of these sites provide you with a counter to these reputation management techniques, allowing you to view and share evidence of previous manipulation attempts that the user may think they have scrubbed from the record.\n\n\nas per the cryptocurrency mantra - **don't trust, verify.**",2,1,,

Expensive problems in Crypto that need solving (that have a real business case basically),"I welcome the rapid decline of Shitcoins like doge and shib (as predominant ones).

Ignore my cynicism or skepticism on cyrpto and can some one who truly believes in cyrpto (that crypto is future, not who are using the hype to increase their money despite not believing in it) answer few basic questions I have.

How can a medium of exchange (currencies) increase in value if they are doing badly in these metrics ? \n\nIf in an imaginary world lets say a countries currency value increases at the same rate as bitcoin in last 3-4 years. Then doesn't everyone hold to their currencies (as cryptobros say hodl), instead of actually investing it in I don't know research, education, real estate, and companies that actually produce something to boost the economy and provide something to people rather than hold to the money? \n\nHow can crypto without regulation replace banks as hundreds of people are losing money on a daily basis on scams, mistakes, hacks and all. And how can a few people with vested interests like exchanges, miners have regulation in place when most developed countries have trouble regulating with billions invested and have lot more visibility than crypto. \n\nAnd if there is regulation, then isn't the first advantage crypto proposes no regulation is automatically vanished? \n\nLets imagine in next 5 years bitcoin increases with this same hype and some manipulation to 200000$ a bitcoin, then what exactly is then end game there? Those who are holding than, what exactly should they do with it? Why will it keep increasing without producing anything productive other than acting like a medium of exchange (rather a slow one)? \n\nAnd aren't many people playing hot potato with things like doge and shib. Does it make sense really to create something out of thin air as a joke really have a value without again I repeat, producing anything valuable to the real world other than acting as a medium exchange and burning huge energy along the way? \n\nAnd please don't explain me anything on the technology.

Investing in crypto safer way.," \n\nHello fellow crypto comrade!\n\nThe most important quality for investing(in anything) IMHO is: - **Patience** (the ability to wait for a long time without becoming annoyed or upset) meaning buying and HODLing.\n\nIt might be hard to go through bear market, but it is the bear **not the bull** that makes you rich.\n\n**What not to do**: FOMO, panic sell on FUD, day trade or overtrade, chasing the pumps, you will lose money 99% of the time.\n\nAvoid greed, it will ruin you. Avoid showing off your gains (scammers love bragging idiots), be modest. Remember 3x is already a good profit.\n\nWhat to do: be **PATIENT**, understand what it is that you are buying, understand the risks, buy the dips or at accumulation zones, take some profits if coin moons. Take calculated risks. Crypto is volatile and that is good, when everybody is panic selling, you **panic buy the dip**.\n\nFollow the brains, where all the smart people are going? It is not likely that you can predict crypto market moves short term, so **Cost Averaging** is the best strategy for accumulation.\n\nStore using hard wallet, I use both Trezor &amp; Ledger.\n\nHave FIAT on the side, do not go ALL IN, it is stupid. **Think ahead**.\n\n**Types of crypto:**\n\n1. **BITCOIN** \- buy and HOLD, sell only if there is **absolutely** nothing else left to do (shitstorm crisis). Bitcoin is absolutely precious and rare, never sell your bitcoin ever. Maybe only to save a life or prevent nuclear alien invasion apocalypses biological war. 75 - 90% of the portfolio. Lowest risk, life changing asset.\n2. **Ethereum** \- Long term hold, maybe take some profits, to return the initial investment, hold 1 to 3 years, then decide. 10 - 20% of the portfolio. Low risk.\n3. **Alt** coins (top 100 by market capitalization) research, buy, hold, sell for gains (in US it is good to hold for a year for tax reasons [https://tokentax.co/help/cryptocurrency-tax-rates/](https://tokentax.co/help/cryptocurrency-tax-rates/)). 5 - 10% of portfolio just in case. Medium risk.\n4. SHIT coins, low cap coins - High risk stuff, you will lose money 9 times out of 10, nether the less that ONE hidden gem shit coin hopium can cover all the losses and take away the pain, and then make you rich as fuck. Maybe risk 1% of portfolio. Have fun gambling. High or Highest risk. Never works.\n\n**Tools to use for research:**\n\n* Crypto Fear &amp; Greed Index [https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/)\n* Bitcoin altcoin season [https://www.blockchaincenter.net/altcoin-season-index/](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/altcoin-season-index/)\n* Also READ some books on the subject. Understand mass psychology, herd behavior, propaganda manipulation. Markets are made of people and humans are pack animals.\n* Coin market cap [https://coinmarketcap.com/](https://coinmarketcap.com/) look at the coin's rating, trading volume, historical chart.\n* DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH, there is a ton of people who will tell you to buy some shit coin, only to disappear as soon as it dumps.\n\n**Buying crypto:**\n\nI use pro.[coinbase.com](https://coinbase.com/) as an onramp to load and unload fiat in USA . For alt coins that I can not buy on coinbase pro I use [kraken](https://craken.com/).com or binance and trade with USDC.
