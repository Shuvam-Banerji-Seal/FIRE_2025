We covered the Coss.io situation in this first episode with this new format, and we focused heavily on some of the mod drama that was put front and center in this subreddit (related to the other subreddit of course).

{"title": "Shitcoin Sunday- Saitama, Lilly Finance, and DD vs FUD", "selftext": "Shitcoin Sunday- Saitama, Lilly Finance, and DD vs FUD\\n\\nThis my first post here and I hope that I am bringing something good to the table. I have enjoyed lurking here for years but am usually too busy to get involved on Reddit. Luckily, I have some extra time on my hands, a few extra bucks to spare, and wanted to bring some awareness of concerns with a token growing in popularity. \\n\\nI like to dabble in shitcoins, where else can you potentially 100x or 1000x your pocket change in a very short time. But this space of the cryptosphere is rife with bullshit and DD is paramount to make sure you don't get rugged. Keep in mind, DD is NOT FUD. It is research into the history of and team behind any investment you are considering. Not doing DD leads to FUD as unsubstantiated rumors swirl. Established facts are not FUD and they should be considered as part of DD.\\n\\nEnter Saitama token. Saitama token was minted as Saitam Inu on May 30, 2021. You can have a poke around the creator wallet here if you want to go down the rabbit hole that I have but this post is not about some of the red flags there.\\n\\nHere is the creator wallet:\\n\\n0x980817e617ca5cDf220e87f5544592BF7a9661b3\\n\\nBack in June when I first came across this token it felt like a money grab. The webpage at that time was full of stock photos of young people and claimed that their goal was education. The Saitama team claimed that they are going to teach young and Gen Z people \"how money works while they invest\" and \"financial literacy\". How were they going to do this? By selling them a shitcoin.\\n\\nFast forward a few months and they have dropped the Inu from their name, they have amassed over 200,000 holders with no major listings, and the token has skyrocketed. Millionaires were made. No educational products were. \\n\\nLast night the devs at Saitama LLC threw a launch party for their new wallet in Vegas and rented a billboard in time square. No wallet is released, not even a beta for public testing, and some drunken youtuber supported by the devs makes a disappointing launch party into a shit show by begging money for drinks for most of his livestream. Public sentiment drops, as does the token price. Just another day in the shitcoin universe. \\n\\nThe other announcement they were celebrating was a new partnership with a medical company. This company, Lilly Finance, claims that they are going to revolutionize medical payments. Go to the Dr and pay with crypto. Their inspiration for this is the CEO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sick daughter. The COO of Saitama LLC is announced as a co-founder of Lilly Finance and you will only be able to buy the Lilly token through Saitamask, the upcoming Saitama wallet. \\n\\nSo who is Lilly Finance? It is a subsidiary of a company called Lillian Bay Medical LLC. Lillian Bay was registered 2 years ago and works in medical wholesale. The CEO of Lillyan Bay has been accused of being a part of a multimillion dollar fraud related to n95 mask distribution and is a defendant in a Racketeer, Influenced, and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) case.\\n\\nHer is the Lilly Finance website:\\n\\n[https://lillyfinance.com](https://lillyfinance.com/)\\n\\nYou can see their corporate registration here:\\n\\n[https://opengovus.com/sam-entity/117736642](https://opengovus.com/sam-entity/117736642)\\n\\nYou can read about the fraud accusation here:\\n\\n[https://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/news/2020/12/30/ceo-of-lillian-bay-medical-accused-of-defrauding.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/news/2020/12/30/ceo-of-lillian-bay-medical-accused-of-defrauding.html)\\n\\nYou can follow the court filings related the the RICO case here:\\n\\n[https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/37687996/TriPharma,\\_Inc\\_v\\_Safe\\_Harvest\\_Medical,\\_LLC](https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/37687996/TriPharma,_Inc_v_Safe_Harvest_Medical,_LLC)\\n\\nSo what is Saitama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship to Lilly Finance and why are they forging an exclusive partnership with them for their wallet launch? I looked up the contract address on the Lilly Finance website and had a poke around. This was difficult to do as the address is an image and not text so I had to manually type it.\\n\\nHere is the contact address if you want to have a look yourself:\\n\\n0xD0222AF85B9B08D38233F4bc940646bf18445949\\n\\nThere I found the address of the wallet that created and currently holds all of the Lilly supply. You can find it here:\\n\\n0x3Af0eD4573E7e1c11CDffE9Af970bff7DCFAffd3\\n\\nOf note is that the first and last transactions from the wallet that created Lillly are a round trip of ETH in and out from a top Saitama whale who has been in Saitama since day one. Remember, the COO of Saitama LLC is on the board of Lilly Finance and is listed as a co-founder. Here is that wallet address:\\n\\n0xF9A98037b5cCd0185161D762278FC009C8056c4e\\n\\nMore worrisome is that said wallet has been dumping huge amounts of Saitama the last several weeks. That person has become very wealthy and their dumps are likely affecting the price of Saitama.\\n\\nSo, we have a professional connection between Lilly and Saitama by way of a common board member and we have financial evidence of connection between an early Saitama investor and the creation of Lilly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s token.\\n\\nWhat does all this mean? That is up to the individual investor to decide. DD is about gathering all of the facts and assessing them against your risk tolerance. Given the sentiment on the Saitama boards greed is strong and these facts don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to matter to many investors.\\n\\nMy broader concerns are with the ethics of both companies. If you are going to bill yourself as financial education this is not the way I would do it. By putting money into either of these projects I am funding the devs. Are these the types of people I want to support?", "links": [{"link": "https://lillyfinance.com](https://lillyfinance.com/)\\n\\nYou", "context": "he Lilly Finance website:\\n\\n[https://lillyfinance.com](https://lillyfinance.com/)\\n\\nYou can see their corporate regis"}, {"link": "https://opengovus.com/sam-entity/117736642](https://opengovus.com/sam-entity/117736642)\\n\\nYou", "context": "porate registration here:\\n\\n[https://opengovus.com/sam-entity/117736642](https://opengovus.com/sam-entity/117736642)\\n\\nYou can read about the fraud accu"}, {"link": "https://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/news/2020/12/30/ceo-of-lillian-bay-medical-accused-of-defrauding.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/news/2020/12/30/ceo-of-lillian-bay-medical-accused-of-defrauding.html)\\n\\nYou", "context": "he fraud accusation here:\\n\\n[https://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/news/2020/12/30/ceo-of-lillian-bay-medical-accused-of-defrauding.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/news/2020/12/30/ceo-of-lillian-bay-medical-accused-of-defrauding.html)\\n\\nYou can follow the court filings "}, {"link": "https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/37687996/TriPharma,\\_Inc\\_v\\_Safe\\_Harvest\\_Medical,\\_LLC](https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/37687996/TriPharma,_Inc_v_Safe_Harvest_Medical,_LLC)\\n\\nSo", "context": "d the the RICO case here:\\n\\n[https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/37687996/TriPharma,\\_Inc\\_v\\_Safe\\_Harvest\\_Medical,\\_LLC](https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/37687996/TriPharma,_Inc_v_Safe_Harvest_Medical,_LLC)\\n\\nSo what is Saitama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relations"}]}

Many teams could enjoy this week as almost all teams gained some valuable points. Growth points are here, and this season is getting spicy. There was some serious movement, and a couple of interesting results. \\n\\nBefore I present the results, here is also one important update, in the next week I will work on a subreddit called: Moonleague. Everybody who wants to follow the results or share some info during game week you are free to do so. Once the subreddit is ready I will inform you with a post. \\n\\nHere are the GAME WEEK 4 results: \\n\\n**Crypto.com vs. Cosmos**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s9ez93elm5r61.png?width=483&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4277a8497e883f484d372b8fca973cf636fdc725\\n\\nThis was a tight game. Crypto.com gained some valuable points this week with Visa piloting the capability with Crypto.com. Cosmos was also pretty active, as they launched IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication), and that are good news for the team. They have managed to get some nice growth points but it was a close battle, and Crypto.com took the victory this week \\n\\n**Tether vs. Uniswap**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/80wp9afom5r61.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56a621cc22fe099dcad72b956869a4bdb3b24d43\\n\\nMystery didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help Tether this week. With news that they are backed by undisclosed reserves, well that brought them just a slight growth rate, still enough to grab at least a point. Some may arguing that Uniswap is to centralized, but nonetheless, Uniswap managed to get a good amount of points this week with a pretty looking growth rate. \\n\\n**XRP vs. Bitcoin Cash**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ubz1hncqm5r61.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57517d0ba96cf64fd66bb582a5c7747fd2948555\\n\\nXRP and SEC, what a love story that is this year. XRP is now worth more today than before the SEC lawsuit, interesting! This week they are back on track, even though they lost this match, they will be happy to grab some valuable points. \\n\\n**Ethereum vs. NEM**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/apbr45zrm5r61.png?width=483&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12bdf781bdcb06dae4d032da1133ceac47bb863e\\n\\nThis week was a good one. Ethereum fans are happy and they finally played a great game and managed to achieve massive gains this week. Ethereum is looking to extend this form also next week and keep on hoping that April is the start of the Altcoin season that everybody was waiting for. NEM didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had any chance this week, but at least they managed to get some growth points out of this, they still need a miracle in the next weeks to stand a chance for a decent spot in the league. \\n\\n**Binance Coin vs. USD Coin** \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xt690mwtm5r61.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0120510bddb533ff55fc1046afb4f3412330dda1\\n\\nBinance did a fantastic job this week, and they pulled out a wonderful growth rate, making them a serious contender for a play-off spot. USD Coin is just grabbing some tiny but important points, and with VISA onboard they are looking to perform even better in the next weeks. \\n\\n**Aave vs. Litecoin**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/esv6sflvm5r61.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7b27bd1c39e92510e77dc7ed5eebaa178abb19b\\n\\nAave announced that they are working with Polygon to bypass Enthereum congestion, and that reflected positively, they finally had a good week and the entire team is now keen to keep pushing further. Litecoin is now available over PayPal, this was not enough for a victory, but they will be happy to take some points and hoping for a good next game week. \\n\\n**Cardano vs. Dogecoin**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1k94c7zxm5r61.png?width=483&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd3ebc9e0324be39224570c826fe8506d16abf25\\n\\nCardano was one of two teams that had a negative rate this week, and the large ADA community is certainly not happy about it. Dogecoin and Elon are in love again, with plans to get them on the moon. In the moonleague, Dogecoin still needs to push a bit harder if they want to get that Moon, still it was a good week and the managed to get some points and a win out of this. \\n\\n**Bitcoin vs. Stellar** \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mdsjiggzm5r61.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33c1ad6783f1ae10bc01670e52d5f4f2d82da59d\\n\\nBitcoin was still able to get some points this week, after a long time they are not in the spotlight, they still managed to get some points here and they will be happy about it. Stellar finally did a good job. After a disappointed start, they grabbed a important win here with a healthy and good looking growth rate. \\n\\n**THETA vs. VeChain**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t515fe11n5r61.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=363644fbc4eaad8a2bf4bfb1867040690115c210\\n\\nTHETA is the dark horse of this competition, and this week the bull run is put on a hold, they lost the game and they lost some points, they will be happy not to lose much here and it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t affect them in terms of their position in the Moonleague. VeChain won, and they it was barely a positive outcome. They will be sad, as they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make the best out of this week, especially with THETA generating some minuses. \\n\\n**Chainlink vs. Polkadot**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kuzc9523n5r61.png?width=483&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3087c856c38f9a80c8e3093b9d68ff171ee636bc\\n\\nChainlink released native substrate module to bring its oracles to Polkadot, and that helped them achieve a nice growth rate, but Polkadot took the upper hand with this week news, making them almost unstoppable this week. We can now say with confidence that Polkadot is back in the game! Great performance from both teams, unfortunate that they played against each other this week, considering the news that both teams announced this week. \\n\\n**LEAGUE TABLE after GAME WEEK 4**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fd1486iim5r61.png?width=1072&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a816a17dc156a360cc4eb82d7b39802170c51e1\\n\\nThere was a lot of movement in the league table this week. We got some new entries into the playoff spot. THETA is still leading the way with a huge gap between them and the second placed VeChain. Mid-table is really interesting with 5 teams having the same amount of points.

{"title": "A quick guide to crypto fundamental analysis", "selftext": "The concept of fundamental analysis entails finding the intrinsic value of a particular crypto by looking at various factors associated with it. It involves digging through its history, understanding its purpose, and what makes it valuable, among others. \\n\\nNot only does this research help determine if the crypto is worth investing in, but you can also use it to check if it is a suitable long-term investment option for you.\\n\\nThe number of cryptos keeps increasing every day. So, it is vital to understand that they are projects usually undertaken by a single person or a group of people. All cryptos do not have the backing of a reputed company or the stability that you might need. \\n\\nTo investigate this and find if crypto is undervalued or overvalued at the moment, investors rely on fundamental analysis. In fact, you will notice several veteran crypto investors use fundamental analysis to understand crypto. \\n\\nThe fundamental analysis of crypto consists of some basic research. For starters, you can analyse the team behind the crypto offering. Usually, every crypto developer has a GitHub profile, where they post updates regarding the project. You can also check the purpose of the project, and if it answers any existing problems in the market.\\n\\nYou can also use factors like the number of wallets created, the number of transactions made, and the volume and frequency of these transactions to gauge an estimation of the crypto?s value. While performing fundamental analysis, you should remember that crypto analysis is vastly different from analysing any other finances. For starters, it requires a lot of research since it is a relatively new space in the market. \\n\\nSecondly, there are a lot of variables involved. To get a better grasp of the fundamental analysis of crypto, hop on to [this detailed blog](https://blog.coindcx.com/cryptocurrency/how-to-do-fundamental-analysis-in-crypto/) by CoinDCX.", "links": [{"link": "https://blog.coindcx.com/cryptocurrency/how-to-do-fundamental-analysis-in-crypto/)", "context": "op on to [this detailed blog](https://blog.coindcx.com/cryptocurrency/how-to-do-fundamental-analysis-in-crypto/) by CoinDCX."}]}
{"title": "Dutch Financial Markets Authority survey: half crypto investors see it as a gamble", "selftext": "The majority of the 1.2 million Dutch crypto investors seem to be aware of the risks involved in investing in crypto currencies. Almost half have only put in a maximum of 500 euros. There is also a group that gets into serious trouble if the price drops. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThis concerns a group of about 100,000 consumers, calculates regulator Authority for the Financial Markets [based on a survey by Ipsos](https://www.afm.nl/~/profmedia/files/nieuws/2021/attitudes-van-cryptobezitters.pdf?la=nl-nl). If 90 percent of the value of their crypto were to evaporate in a month, they would have a financial problem that they would not be able to absorb, or only with great difficulty. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nA 90 percent drop in value, by the way, is extreme, says the AFM. The authority regularly warns of the dangers of investing in crypto currencies because they do not fall under their supervision. This increases the risk of unsuspecting investors putting their money in a pyramid scheme disguised as a crypto currency. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAnother major risk for investors is the violent price fluctuations. The largest crypto, bitcoin, went from a price of about $30,000 (26,600 euros) this year to well over double that, collapsed again to below 30,000, climbed to a record high of $69,000 and has now fallen again by about 30 percent to $50,000 value. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Less return, also less stress**\\n\\nBy the way, the stock price is still 73 percent higher than on January 1 of this year. By comparison, the AEX is about 28 percent higher, but the price of the main Dutch stock market index went up and down a lot less. The moment at which someone decided to invest, therefore, mattered less and the chance of losing (part of) your deposit is also smaller if you suddenly need the money. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nInvestors also do take into account a crash in the price of crypto currencies. Of all the risks surrounding cryptos, this one tops the list, followed by losing the investment due to theft, scams or the bankruptcy of an exchange or crypto exchange. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWhen assessing risk, it is notable that those who also invest in things other than just cryptos are a lot more pessimistic than those who have put all their cards on cryptos.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Small amounts**\\n\\nThe latter group, on the other hand, is a bit more cautious about how much money they put in. More than half of the group that only invests in cryptos, only invests with an amount of up to 500 euros. This may also have to do with the fact that relatively many young people invest in cryptos, and they have even less to spend. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAmong those who invest not only in cryptos but also in stocks, for example, the group that invests only such a relatively small amount is a lot smaller. Almost a third invest for a maximum of 500 euros, 35 percent are in it for an amount of at least 2,500 euros.", "links": [{"link": "https://www.afm.nl/~/profmedia/files/nieuws/2021/attitudes-van-cryptobezitters.pdf?la=nl-nl).", "context": " [based on a survey by Ipsos](https://www.afm.nl/~/profmedia/files/nieuws/2021/attitudes-van-cryptobezitters.pdf?la=nl-nl).

One more important thing is I always took Principle (Investment) on the pump and get my investment Principle. This all happened in the span of a few weeks. I wanted my initial investment back. I only kept *495 Matic* worth of *PNT Token* at that time and put that into a Trust wallet Dapp.\\n\\nThe price of PNT has moved up to 0.002240 matic. It's still early until it reaches 1 PNT = 1 Matic\\n\\nIntroduction Of PNT Token\\n\\nThe Polyatomic Network is a decentralized application based on the Polygon blockchain that has been capturing value by offering the most attractive spreads, an auto-adjusting spec and consumption component, and frictionless, separate compensation for a long time in the MATIC coin.\\n\\nThis is probably the best work on Polygon Blockchain that can generate unregulated revenue through the fantastic protocol in dApps.\\n\\nTheir local area strengths coupled with fun opportunities, and a ton of imaginative changes to the digital currency universe will cause it to grow into an enterprise worth watching.\\n\\nThe PNT TOKEN:\\n\\nPNT (Polytomic Network Token) is the power and close by token for Polytomic Network. The PNT savvy understanding is a self-making pay framework for holders.\\n\\nIt is a neighborhood project that spreads and remunerates MATIC between neighborhoods subject to clear conditions.\\n\\nIt was built on the Polygon blockchain, and PNT tokens can be purchased with MATIC in the Polyatomic dApp on TrustWallet/Metamask.\\n\\nThe installment to buy PNT is in MATIC and not in dollars, so eventually you will have the opportunity to profit from any cost increase. Holders can sell their PNT at the point when they need it which makes it perfectly suited for them.\\n\\nNothing is found on record so holders get two benefits in MATIC coin as well as price energy for PNT which becomes more MATIC.\\n\\nRewards\\n\\nThe MATIC reflection token has shown the ultimate fate of biological systems. HODLers of PNT will receive secret rewards by basically holding the tokens in their wallets, as each exchange such as purchases, sales and profit withdrawals individually has spending fees of 10%, 10% and 10% which are all existing symbolically. is expressed equally. In the wallet of the holders is indicated by their PNT volume.\\n\\nFor each exchange, a piece is saved to boost the liquidity pool and prize pool for all holders. Thereafter, PNT intends to pursue a 'Hold and Procure' culture, thereby reducing the selling pressure.\\n\\nThis is accomplished through smart contract capacities, which mechanize the symbolic rearrangement, and those holders should simply deal with the wallet in which their tokens are put away.\\n\\nRewards are naturally accessible to circulate once every new client purchases the PNT in their dApp. Probably the best element is that you have control of your own prizes payouts by pulling out at whatever point you need in the Polytomic dApp.\\n\\nBenefits Of Income\\n\\nThe benefits of income are very important here. The Polyatomic Network (PNT) is the first to provide huge income from its system whenever someone buys a PNT token. 65% goes to the PNT community and 35% is distributed to all PNT holders according to their PNT holdings. So here you have maximum PNT and you will get big profit.\\n\\n\\nThe second biggest benefit is passive income. Here one can make $1,000,000 matic or more by passive or by recommending other people. The above passive is described as your direct reference (1st level) you get 10%, 2nd level 4%, 3rd level 2%, 4th level 1%, 5th to 10th level 0.5%, 11th to 14th level 0.25% And get 15th level. The level is 1%. One can make huge profits by recommending through this robust system.\\n\\n\\n Step by Step Instructions to Start\\n\\n1. Download Trustwallet or MetaMask and send all MATIC into it through your trade by means of the Polygon organization.\\n\\n2. Go to dApps section in trustwallet and paste this link?[Polytomic ](https://polytomic.network/registration/?referral=0xd4320bE6BFC32dDF53480140a12ceEC4C20B1549)\\n\\n3. Ensure that you are associated with the polygon Network which you can see on the upper right of the picture.\\n\\n4. Subsequent to associating with the wallet, store all the MATIC that you have and enlist it.\\n\\n5. There you go, now you?re a holder of Polytomic Network Token. Get ready to receive a daily dividend!\\n\\nThis is another undertaking with many things on the way. This is a great opportunity to buy a ton of MATICs and for those who have opened doors like this before. Assuming you have any inquiries and guides, then go ahead and message me on Telegram and WhatsApp.\\n\\nPNT is the project that successfully gave away thousands of metrics while holding the PNT token. As the price of PNT's Matic and Community increases, the PNT's price also increases, resulting in more Polygon (Matic) earnings.\\n\\nIf you found this article helpful, follow, clap and share with your friends!\\n\\nI would also be grateful (no pressure) if you decide to use my referral link here!\\n\\nDisclaimer : This is not financial advice, the information in this article is for educational purposes only.

{"title": "A Oasis protocol (ROSE) shill post.", "selftext": "Felt like a proper shill post is warranted these days as most posts right now are just low effort articles or posts about DCA. \\n\\n\\n**Fundamentals:**\\n\\n-What is ROSE/Oasis Protocol? It's an L1 which can serve as an L2 and can allow ANY L1 to process secure, private off chain computation or give privacy qualities to literally any other crypto. The main implications of these are:\\n\\nPeople can control and monetize their data, companies can monetize data of their customers further without violating privacy laws, DeFi can offer new products such as under collateralized lending.\\n\\nParcel allows users and/or companies to store data on chain and sell or just make that data available without any of the personal information attached to said data. As example you can think of having medical records on chain. These records could help medical research and this can then be done without giving out your personal data (name and such). A partnership with Genetica has been formed to make this happen. \\n\\nA good article is here: https://docs.oasis.dev/oasis-network-primer/\\n\\n**tl;dr**: Rose unlocks an entirely new set of use cases &amp; products for crypto and allows corporations to play roles they otherwise would not be able to.\\n\\n-Dawn Song, the founder and CEO of Oasis Labs &amp; the Oasis Protocol, is the world's most reputable computer security scientist. A lot of her work is used as foundational components for some of the biggest crypto projects today. She is also a co-founder of a reputable cyber security company called Menlo Security which has thousands of REAL (not crypto vaporcompanies) customers including many F500's, and its last valuation was $800MM and it's very likely valued at over $1B today.\\n\\n**Product Roadmap:**\\n\\nOasis Labs' largest current product is called Parcel which is the core product for the \"letting companies monetize data in new ways\" concept. It is currently in use by several F500 companies and also a handful of other REAL non-crypto companies. However, Parcel is NOT yet on mainnet\\n\\nOnce Parcel is on mainnet, Oasis will officially have the most real world (non-crypto) usage outside of anything other than maybe ETH. In short: It's not just some DeFi shitcoin PnD chain like pretty much everything else is. It's coming to the table right away with more useful adoption than ANYTHING else has.\\n\\nThey're also soon to release both a Cipher and ETH paratime and bridges which will immediately alllow anyone to port over dapps, tokens, etc. to the network and make it usable for the majority of the crypto space, meaning all the DeFi use cases and even new use cases will be available for existing crypto entities.\\n\\n**Pumpamentals:**\\n\\n-ROSE had one of the highest VC raises of all time in crypto ($45MM in 2018) and has operated totally under the radar, finally launching the network in late 2020. -The VCs are legit crypto VC funds like a16z, Fred Eshram, Polychain, Binance, and others. Salesforce is listed on the Oasis Labs website but I can't find them listed on the Salesforce Ventures site so it's hard to know for sure about this one.\\n \\n-Recent history shows us with similar projects from a VC perspective, they ultimately pump like fucking crazy. Solana is a great example, and a lot of the same capital is invested in ROSE. These are players used to seeing minimally 50-100x on their investments and right now the earliest ones only have about a 5x. There is no fucking chance given the fundamentals they are going to sell ROSE for anything less than a 100x, mark my words ($3) and I am willing to bet many will hold large portions of their holdings way beyond that. -The public is starting to take notice. Whether it's discord shilling or whatever, I see more shitty crypto influencers starting to mention it, and it's only a matter of time before everyone does a full feature on ROSE and crypto twitter is talking about it. You are still early to the show that we're just watching start to unfold now. \\n\\n- Noteworthy to mention as well is Oasis's partnership with Meta something that should be highlighted by both Oasis and Meta very soon as said in the most recent Townhall meeting (1st of June). Seems to me at least that Meta will use Parcel to give users a way to monetize their data, but most importantly it gives Meta a more legal way to collect and sell/use data without violating privacy laws. \\n\\n**Fud:**\\n\\n-Token supply: 10B. Yea, it's a lot. We can easily just say \"crypto is a clown market, look at ADA ($3 at 45B max supply putting ROSE at a $13.50 price tag) or XRP or DOGE or whatever but I want to look beyond the clown market. The token release schedule is over TEN years. As I stated in pumpamentals it's very unlikely in the November unlock (which is one of the bigger ones) VCs just dump their bags. That would really surprise me. In 10 years, can a chain that enables entirely new important privacy oriented use cases have a market cap of a mere $10B? In TEN FUCKING YEARS? That's $1 ROSE. But realistically by then I think the mcap will be in the hundreds of billions of dollars, partly due to inflation but largely due to crypto adoption being in near full force by then. I see no reason ROSE can't hit $5-10 within the next couple of years and I actually think it could be a $20+ coin one day. -\"It's just another L1/ETH killer\". No, it's an L1 but it is a VERY critical L2 and the L1 properties which are important right now have no competitors. It's an ETH enabler. In fact, much like LINK, it will enable everything in crypto to be more valuable than it already is.\\n\\n-Here's fud that I think is somewhat REAL but never actually gets discussed: There are no concrete plans for token holders to monetize their tokens after the staking gains wash up. Validators are not required to pay out on transaction fee profits, and none of them currently do. The theory is, the network will grow to a point where there will be plenty of alternative ways to monetize your ROSE via dapps (whether that's in DeFi or via a type of company/product that doesn't even exist yet), and empowering the ecosystem in other ways, that by the time staking gains dry up you'll still have reasons to hold. I'd look at this as a tl;dr of \"network succeeds - you win, network loses - token is worthless to you\", but if the network doesn't succeed the token will be worthless anyway. Additionally, I could see a world where validators are trying to accumulate bigger stacks to process more jobs and get a larger % of the network fees and so DO start paying a share of transaction fees to anyone staking with them. I think that's how it will play out. But ultimately, you also will always have the option to run your own validator and the crypto space is making this easier and easier for people.\\n\\n**Disclaimer:**\\n\\nI didn't write most of this myself just changed a few things to make it up-to-date. This write up was made by an anonymous user on 4chan. I also am heavily invested in ROSE myself so take that into consideration as well. \\n\\nWould also not advice investing in ROSE at this time due to the current market situation, would just suggest on keeping an eye on ROSE for when the market turns more bullish again.", "links": [{"link": "https://docs.oasis.dev/oasis-network-primer/\\n\\n**tl;dr**:", "context": ". \\n\\nA good article is here: https://docs.oasis.dev/oasis-network-primer/\\n\\n**tl;dr**: Rose unlocks an entirely new "}]}

There are rumors of Honduras, but Malaysia is emerging as a willing country to legalize cryptocurrency.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Consider making crypto a legal tender**\\n\\nDatuk Zahidi Zainul Abidin, Malaysia's Deputy Minister in the Ministry of Communications and Multimedia, [told parliament](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2022/03/21/comms-ministry-proposes-adopting-cryptocurrency-as-legal-tender) Monday that the country should consider adopting cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin as legal tender.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Youth love NFT**\\n\\nThe reason? The deputy minister is looking to the future and the youth. By making cryptocurrency a legal tender, he wants to support the young generation. Young Malaysians are active users of crypto and according to Abidin, they are also very active on exchanges for non-fungible tokens (NFT).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*\"We hope the government will allow and legalize this so we can increase the acceptance of cryptocurrencies by young people.\"*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Future of finance**\\n\\nFor a politician, this is incredibly progressive. Just go figure, when have you heard a politician so concrete with solutions to help the youth. Zahidi said his Ministry of Communications and Multimedia will explore ways to increase youth involvement in digital currency, as this is the future of finance.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Central bank determines**\\n\\nHe acknowledged that his ministry can only express the desire, but that the keys are in the hands of the central bank and the financial watchdog.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*\"All these fall under the jurisdiction of Bank Negara Malaysia and the Securities Commission,\"* he said.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHis statement did not come out of the blue. Yesterday, Zahidi said this in the Dewan Rakyat in response to a supplementary question from Syed Ibrahim Syed Noh (other politician) about the government's position on trading on NFT platforms. Indeed, trading is becoming increasingly popular, especially among the younger generation.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Investigation into CBDC.**\\n\\nThis is the first time that cryptocurrency has come out as legal tender in Malaysia. It was previously announced, however, that Malaysia joined a central bank digital currency study (CBDC) with the Bank for International Settlements, Singapore, Australia and South Africa. The aim is to test real life cross-border CBDC transactions.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Permission for share tokens**\\n\\nThere is more news from Malaysia. Fusang Corp. a Malaysia-based digital stock exchange, [has announced](https://www.fusang.co/news/fusang-announces-first-digital-security-ipo-public-listing-for-a-defi-platform) that it has obtained regulatory approval for an initial public offering (IPO) of its share tokens. This is somewhat similar to BNB on the Binance exchange, but with regulatory approval.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Genuine share certificates**\\n\\nThe tokens represent Fusang's shares in digital form, and are registered on a blockchain (from Ethereum) rather than a traditional share register. They will be listed on Fusang's own Exchange within a few weeks, Fusang CEO Henry Chong told me. While other companies have issued security tokens in the past, Fusang's will be the world's first IPO of fully regulated share tokens, according to Chong.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*\"This is not a token assigned somewhere to an offline paper share,\"* Chong said. *\"This is not a derivative or anything like that. These tokens are really the share certificates and we sincerely believe that this is the future of the security token market.\"*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Emergence of security tokens**\\n\\nThis has been the promise of security tokens for years: that shares of companies are converted into tokens with legal and notarial approval.

{"title": "Introducing Payments and Transactions - How cryptocurrency blockchains work in the simplest terms.", "selftext": "Bitcoin is a digital currency, with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coin\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in its name, and the original White Paper describes it as electronic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cash\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and mentions \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wallets.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d So people may assume when payments are made, coins move from address to address, from wallet to wallet. This is not at all how Bitcoin works, the coins and wallets analogy is just that, an analogy.\\n\\n###How cryptocurrency blockchains actually work\\n\\nSuppose Alice wants to send One Bitcoin (BTC) to Bob\\n\\n- First she composes a new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctransaction message\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which reference the funds in her \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwallet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. These funds are composed of a combination of some of her previous transactions. These are known as the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinputs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The sum of the inputs must total exactly or almost invariably more than the amount (due to fees), the amount she wants to send to Bob. \\n\\n- She must also note the address or public key to which she wants to send funds. These are called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcoutputs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. She signs the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctransaction message\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with her private keys corresponding to the input addresses and broadcasts it on the peer-to-peer network. \\n\\n- It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unlikely that Alice will have a single prior transaction that she can use to pay Bob (i.e. 1.01 BTC, exactly one bitcoin plus the appropriate mining fee). More likely she will have many different possible \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunspent outputs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to choose from 0.87 - 0.34 - 1.15 - 3.5 - 0.02 - 0.001 - To make a payment she must combine these funds in such a way that she makes the correct payment to Bob. \\n\\n- So, she could use one big input (like the one for 3.5 bitcoins) and get change of 2.49 bitcoins back by including a second output for that amount to an address that she controls. The transaction would now have one input and two outputs.\\n\\n- Alternatively she could use two small inputs (like the ones for 0.87 and 0.34) but still want change (i.e. 0.2) for which she would provide a change address. That transaction would therefore have two inputs and two outputs.\\n\\n- If all goes well, a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcminer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 will include the transaction in the next block after verifying that the inputs and signatures are valid. The transaction is now complete and Bob can now reference this completed transaction as an input into a future transaction when he wants to move his funds.\\n\\nThe key thing to realize is that there are no individual, atomic units of bitcoin that are transferred among addresses. What individuals \u00e2\u20ac\u0153own\u00e2\u20ac\u009d are not bitcoins, but unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) that can serve as inputs for new transactions.\\n\\n###Why is this important to understand? Not your \u00e2\u20ac\u02dckeys\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 not your \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwallet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122!\\n\\nBecause it is not possible to track individual units of bitcoin, many legal questions of criminal activity and regulation (notably taxable events) are raised. Governments, law enforcement or criminals, can not track individual coins and instead concentrate on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwallet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 addresses.

This makes decentralized gabling more appetible to many users who are passionate about gambling. That being said there are also a few downsides to it. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s start by addressing in full what decentralized gambling actually means.\\n\\n**How does decentralized gambling work?**\\n\\nDecentralized gambling is essentially a method of gambling that provides a mechanism for players to attach their cryptocurrency wallets to the operator website, therefore giving them full control over their funds at all times. These wallets are linked to blockchain technology which is the key to offering the decentralized gambling industry with security, privacy and cost-effectiveness. This is in part due to the fact that the blockchain database creates a decentralized digital and chronological record of all transactions that take place. This serves both casino operators and players well because it increases confidence in transactions that do not need to be analyzed by a third party in order to ensure fairness.\\n\\n**The main differences between decentralized and centralized gambling**\\n\\nAs stated above, the main difference is that rather than being stored on a centralized server, decentralized gambling applications are stored on a crypto\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blockchain. But what does that mean for the actual lived experience of the player? First of all, they are not dependent on gambling operators for processes and formalities such as deposits and receiving their winnings, like they would be in a normal online casino. \\n\\nWith crypto gambling, there is no central authority, meaning that players have full liberty on their transactions (deposits, withdrawals and fund distributions) which are, again, recorded, transparent and open to all. Players therefore do not face delays in receiving their winnings, which in decentralized gambling are released immediately by smart contracts.\\n\\nAnother key difference is anonymity. In centralized online casinos, players must open accounts by inserting personal details like name, address, as well as usually having to provide photo ID and a copy of credit cards. Such compliances are unnecessary in decentralized gambling as players gamble through their unique wallet address and only have to provide a name and email address.\\n\\n**The link between blockchain and security**\\n\\nAs previously implied, an elevated degree of security is one of the main attractions that decentralized gambling can offer. This is primarily due to the fact that this form of betting depends on cryptocurrency transactions. The lack of a centralized authority or third-party verification enables players to have full liberty over their transactions and ensures that there are almost no chances of fraud occurring. \\n\\nThis happens because all movements, including withdrawals, deposits and other fund distributions, are recorded on an instrument called the distributed ledger technology (DLT) of the blockchain, and are furthermore processed by smart contracts that can be accessed and surveyed by anyone at any time, giving the process the utmost level of transparency.\\n\\n[https://decentralizedgambling.io/](https://decentralizedgambling.io/)", "links": [{"link": "https://decentralizedgambling.io/](https://decentralizedgambling.io/)", "context": "st level of transparency.\\n\\n[https://decentralizedgambling.io/](https://decentralizedgambling.io/)"}]}

{"title": "The \"Metaverse\" and VR/AR is clunky and awful right now, but Apple's first PDA \"tablet\" was an even worse experience before it all came together with the first iPhone", "selftext": "Behold the [Apple Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Newton), released in 1993 in all it's archaic glory!\\n\\nWhen this bad boy released everyone thought tablets and pocket-sized mobile computing devices were a joke.  We all thought that the kinds of mobile computing tablets they had on Star Trek The Next Generation were some sort of futuristic thing we would never see in our lifetimes, akin to the floating hoverboards or flying cars we saw in Back to the Future part II.\\n\\nIt's true: the user experience on these early PDA devices was truly awful.  The hardware was bulky, slow, unintuitive, poorly designed, expensive, and the software was just as bad as it had no developer ecosystem.\\n\\nMany people scoffed at the tech and thought it was a stupid idea that would never become mainstream.  They could never envision themselves or anyone else ever using these kinds of things en masse or outside of them being some niche toy for the obscenely rich.\\n\\n24 years later, after many technological advances in hardware, software, and design, the first iPhone was released and it changed everything.\\n\\nYes, the metaverse as it currently stands is like an Apple Newton or maybe some kind of early Palm or Blackberry device.  A niche industry which is awkward, expensive and which only a handful of enthusiasts can geek out on.\\n\\nIt takes a lot of time for the hardware technology, design philosophy, and software to all get developed and meld into something that really catches the public's attention.  VR/AR is even more difficult to implement well as the hardware technology is much more complex, not to mention the user design and software which all requires time to mature and grow.\\n\\nThere will also be many failures.  Many PDA designs failed miserably and were completely scrapped, many companies went bankrupt along with their stockholders being left holding the bag.  But the idea and the technology continued marching ahead.\\n\\nWhen you look at new technologies and new ideas, you need to take this sort of development time into consideration.  No one could have imagined the mobile device and software app ecosystem we have now back in 1993, or even 2003.\\n\\nRight now many of us are still looking at the metaverse and VR/AR like some kind of futuristic tech, like how we viewed tablets on Star Trek TNG back in the 90's.  Many of us can't imagine or see ourselves using such clunky tech with such niche use cases or scenarios.  We're still very much at the forefront of this emerging space, and the big VR/AR equivalent of the iPhone has yet to be discovered that will shift mainstream opinion of these devices.\\n\\nBut you can bet your crypto that there are many MANY people at work in figuring out how to make the next \"iPhone\"-like paradigm shift in this space.  How long it will take and how many failures along the way remains to be seen, but those that keep up with the space and understand the direction of where things are going are going to have many golden opportunities for investment in front of them, so long as they also understand that being this early also presents many risks and pitfalls.", "links": [{"link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Newton),", "context": "one Behold the [Apple Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Newton), released in 1993 in all it's "}]}

Many questions to be answered in clear here. Is it okay when 90% of mining power in Bitcoin [can gather in one room](https://twitter.com/lopp/status/673398201307664384)? Is it okay when 2 or 3 mining pools control majority of hashing power, so can do censorship? Is it okay when almost all the new nodes avoid processing a blockchain from its genesis block? Is it okay when a Proof-of-Work coin developers are doing a hard-fork changing the consensus algorithm to make it GPU-friendly again? Can we summarize all the issues with decentralization? Can we cover most of issues with technical means?Decentralization is about many issues lying in many fields, of technical, social, and hybrid kinds. Researchers and developers are trying to find technical solutions, preferably, elegant and efficient. However, for many issues such solutions are not known, thus social solutions are also needed.In this article I will cover only technical aspects of decentralization, namely, decentralization of mining and decentralization of verification.## Decentralization of MiningThe two biggest concerns about decentralization of mining are specialized hardware (such as ASICs) and centralized pools.With ASICs, a big player capable to invest enough money into R;D can get unfair advantage from privately owned efficient hardware. In principle, for any kind of computational activity it is always possible to develop specialized hardware performing better than commodity computing units, such and CPUs and GPUs. However, for different computational tasks R;D efforts and possible outcome could vary a lot. Reasoning behind a search for a perfect (or close enough to perfect) could be quite complex (see e.g. 30 pages long [Equihash paper](http://ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger/article/view/48)).For most of Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies (including Bitcoin, Ethereum, ZCash), 2 to 4 centralized mining pools  control majority of mining power. This could mean easy censorship or frontrunning on applications (for example, reordering exchange orders), as in centralized pools only pool decides block candidate for the whole pool to work on. As a possible outcome, non-outsourceable mining schemes can prevent centralized pools formation. Only [Ergo Platform](https://ergoplatform.org/en/) is known for deploying a practical non-outsourceable Proof-of-Work scheme (based on a supposedly memory-harder problem from the [Equihash paper](http://ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger/article/view/48)) called [Autolykos](https://docs.ergoplatform.com/ErgoPow.pdf).As an example where social decentralization issues meet the decentralization of mining, sometimes developers of Proof-of-Work are introducing hard-forks to make a Proof-of-Work algorithm GPU-friendly again once ASICs are going to dominate in the mining market for the coin, however, it is always not quite clear why totally legit activity is banned and why developers (along with some users) can do hard-fork for this particular reason.## Decentralization of VerificationDecentralization of verification is about possibility to check validity of blockchain history. Such check provides confidence that nothing bad (i.e not conforming to a protocol) was injected to the blockchain and thus give a user a right to reject malicious chain even if it has absorbed more work than alternatives. There were many talks about such the right in the Bitcoin community when it was partly hot about User-Activated Soft Fork (UASF) idea, and recent article [\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdWho secures Bitcoin?\"](https://medium.com/@BitcoinErrorLog/who-secures-bitcoin-95b19bbcda3c) is summarizing this way of thinking well.If verification can be done in reasonable time only by an entity able to spend millions on renting a datacenter, obviously a network is not decentralized. Ideally, it should be possible to check integrity of the whole blockchain on commodity hardware, like a decent laptop.However, new blockchains also tend to absorb more and more features, and they are not coming for free. Then the huge topic in the research community is about how to make possible to check integrity of the whole blockchain with pruned blocks or system state (or both) under plausible assumptions. Possible solutions here are about bootstrapping state snapshot and blockchain suffix on top of it (popular in Ethereum protocol clients, and formalized in [an academic paper even](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/129.pdf)), stateless clients ([partially stateless](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/994), as implemented in [Ergo Platform](https://ergoplatform.org/en/) or [fully stateless](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/968) which do exist only in research papers currently).", "links": [{"link": "https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019\\_12\\_12\\_new\\_quest/](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_12_12_new_quest/)", "context": " Quest for Decentralization  [https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019\\_12\\_12\\_new\\_quest/](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_12_12_new_quest/)  https://preview.redd.it/f44p"}, {"link": "https://preview.redd.it/f44p1dg7jpd41.jpg?width=850;format=pjpg;auto=webp;s=49471e04d4d55450f70b5ca450f667e62fc6f354While", "context": "/blog/2019_12_12_new_quest/)  https://preview.redd.it/f44p1dg7jpd41.jpg?width=850;format=pjpg;auto=webp;s=49471e04d4d55450f70b5ca450f667e62fc6f354While most active conversations tod"}, {"link": "https://twitter.com/lopp/status/673398201307664384)?", "context": "coin [can gather in one room](https://twitter.com/lopp/status/673398201307664384)?

{"title": "crypto tax software bug", "selftext": "My name is Sung Hwang.  I wanted to share my negative experience with [cryptotrader.tax](https://cryptotrader.tax).  I think [t](https://cryptotrader.tax)he company changed its name to Coinledger.  In short, it is about two defects, bugs, I found in their tax software in 2021.  \\n\\n\tIn 2021, I used their free version online tax calculation service.  I found two bugs in their software.  I can say conclusively that I found bugs in their tax software because I notified them by email about the bugs and later they emailed me back and acknowledged the bugs.       \\n\\n\tHere were the two bugs.  1.  Their software processed some of my coin purchases as income.  It would have raised my tax because having crypto income means I had to pay income tax.   2.  Their software did not add some of my coin selling fees to the cost basis.  So, that also would've raised my tax.     \\n\\n\tI understand software have bugs.  Although it took two months, they eventually fixed the bugs as far as I can tell.  But here is the problem, by the time the bugs were supposedly fixed, it was August 2021, 4 months after the regular tax season was over.  There had to many people who were affected by their software and paid more tax than they had to as a result.  Despite my repeated request to the company, they seemed to be refusing to notify their customers who were affected by the bugs.  Here is my detailed email exchanges with them.      \\n\\n\tIn august 2021, after they asked me to test their software again to confirm the bugs were fixed.  I think it worked correctly.  Then I emailed them asking them if they were going to notify their affected customers about the bugs. And here is what they wrote in their reply email on Aug 27, 2021, 11:01 AM\\n\\n\"I appreciate the concern here and yes, we do plan to notify our customers so that they can re-import their data for Kraken. We follow a standard practice for this in which our dev team runs an affected user analysis and then we will send an outreach by email to all the affected users. We are committed to addressing any errors and helping our customers to get the correct calculations. Thank you for reaching out about this issue and for providing evidence that made it very easy to escalate and then resolve the bug. Please let me know if you have any more feedback or concerns that I can share with our team.\"\\n\\n\tRight away, I replied asking when they were going to send out the notification.  And here is what they wrote in the reply email on Sep 6, 2021, 11:52 AM\\n\\n\t\"Thanks for following up in this. Our engineers are running a query in the production database to determine all the affected users, and then our David, our CEO will be sending out a message. This should be completed by the end of this week. The good news is that based on the the initial survey from our integrations team, this bug was detected pretty early and only affects a fraction of Kraken users. I'll be sure to message you directly once the email has gone out.\"\\n\\n\tOne month later, I emailed asking for an update.  They replied as below on Sep 28, 2021, 9:47 AM\\n\\n\t\"Thanks for checking in about this. It has taken a bit longer than expected to run the query in our production database as we want to extra thorough in collecting all affected users. We should have this completed within the next week. Feel free to send another follow up message if you do not hear from me.\"\\n\\n\tThat was the last email I received from them.  I emailed them  in October, again in November asking for an update.

{"title": "What is Monero and Why it is key on reaching absolute Anonymity and Privacy on Crypto", "selftext": " \\n\\n\\#What Is Monero (XMR)?\\n\\nMonero is just like every other crypto which makes it digital currency. The main difference between Monero and every other Cryptocurrency is the fact that Monero is fungible and can't be linked to any user or identity. The term fungible refers to a currency where every unit is identical and mutually interchangeable with another unit of the same value. So Bitcoin received from the illegal transaction can be distinguished from a Bitcoin bought on Coinbase or Binance through blockchain analysis, two separate Monero coins transacted from darknet or Binance appear exactly the same and can't be distinguished. This is the reason financial regulators can trace Bitcoin transactions but not XMR payments.\\n\\n\\#How Does Monero (XMR) Work?\\n\\nMonero is able to maintain privacy and anonymity through these two important processes: Stealth addresses and Ring signature\\n\\nStealth addresses allow the sender to create a public address on behalf of the recipient for every single transaction. So every transaction is able to create its own public address to maintain privacy and anonymity. Every Monero user can generate a private view key and a private spend key. The private view key allows the user to see transactions within their account but is unable to transact with it. While the private spend key allows them to authorize payments and transactions\\n\\nRing signatures is a concept from cryptography which means that the signature can be signed by any member of a specific group of people who possess private keys. Every time someone makes a XMR transaction, the Monero wallet forms a ring from other users' keys it pulls from the blockchain. It makes it impossible for people observing which and whose keys were being used to sign. Furthermore, in January 2017, Monero introduced RingCT which hides the value of transactions.\\n\\n\\#What Makes Monero (XMR) Unique?\\n\\nMonero has anonymous developers and open-source code. It may sound similar to Bitcoin but there are major differences, most notably by the way updates and forks are handled. Monero's software is programmed to update every six months autonomously unlike Bitcoin which is somewhat reluctant when it comes to forks or updates.\\n\\nFor Monero users, the value of Monero comes from its privacy and anonymity. It liberates Monero users to transact whenever and for whatever reason they want without being able to be observed by anyone. In addition to that, a lot of its investors believe that demand for privacy will increase over time and drive up the price of the XMR itself.\\n\\n\\#What Is the Supply of Monero (XMR)?\\n\\nMonero (XMR) currently has a circulating supply of 18,004,702 XMR. It will reach a total supply of 18.4 million XMR by May 2022. There is no max supply in the Monero blockchain and it will continue to produce 0.6 XMR per block infinitely to incentivize the miners.\\n\\n\\#Conclusion\\n\\nWhile Bitcoin will always pioneers the crypto industry as being the first digital currency ever created. Monero differentiates itself from other cryptos by being the most private and achieved financial anonymity. Although there are a few other privacy coins available on the market, Monero is able to differentiate itself by features such as stealth addresses and ring signatures, plus the ASIC resistance, and able to become the biggest privacy coin by market cap.\\n\\nThe Monero (XMR) success is also driven by the fact that the community itself is driven more by ideals of complete anonymity should be a fundamental right rather than pursue of profits.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHelpful Links\\n\\n[https://www.getmonero.org/](https://www.getmonero.org/)\\n\\n[https://www.investopedia.com/tech/introduction-monero-xmr/](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/introduction-monero-xmr/)\\n\\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/13/what-is-monero-new-cryptocurrency-of-choice-for-cyber-criminals.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/13/what-is-monero-new-cryptocurrency-of-choice-for-cyber-criminals.html)\\n\\n[https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-monero-xmr](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-monero-xmr)\\n\\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/monero/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/monero/)", "links": [{"link": "https://www.getmonero.org/](https://www.getmonero.org/)\\n\\n[https://www.investopedia.com/tech/introduction-monero-xmr/](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/introduction-monero-xmr/)\\n\\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/13/what-is-monero-new-cryptocurrency-of-choice-for-cyber-criminals.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/13/what-is-monero-new-cryptocurrency-of-choice-for-cyber-criminals.html)\\n\\n[https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-monero-xmr](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-monero-xmr)\\n\\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/monero/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/monero/)", "context": ";#x200B;\\n\\nHelpful Links\\n\\n[https://www.getmonero.org/](https://www.getmonero.org/)\\n\\n[https://www.investopedia.com/tech/introduction-monero-xmr/](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/introduction-monero-xmr/)\\n\\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/13/what-is-monero-new-cryptocurrency-of-choice-for-cyber-criminals.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/13/what-is-monero-new-cryptocurrency-of-choice-for-cyber-criminals.html)\\n\\n[https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-monero-xmr](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-monero-xmr)\\n\\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/monero/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/monero/)"}]}

{"title": "Optimizing 2022 (and beyond) crypto coin allocation", "selftext": "Medium-term lurker, first time poster here. So I paid off my student loans at the start of this year, and since have gotten really interested in crypto. Despite clear guidance here and repeated admonishments from my wife, I left lots of money on the table this year through dumb day trading. [Face palm](https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/captain-picard-facepalm-bust/intro-import.webp). It turns out that DCA and HODL ***truly*** is the time-honored advice for a reason . . .\\n\\nSo here I am at the start of 2022, looking to firmly HODL my portfolio for at least the next 3-5 years and/or until it hits a particular long-term price. My current portfolio allocation, projected 2022 buying allocation (and the resulting net allocation), long-term price goal (and corresponding multiplier against today's prices) are all below. \\n\\nI am teeming with questions for those with a lot more experience:\\n\\n1. *2022 allocation among coins*: what do folks think about the proposed allocation among coins for 2022? Many are informed by cool projects I first discovered here. For price volatility and risk balancing concerns, I go back and forth on whether I should allocate more to ETH (like 40-45%), maybe by scaling back my DOT (as a total investor newbie, I got suckered into buying more in November as the price plummeted). Do folks think that's too much in relatively unproven projects like ATOM, ONE, and CKB? Need any re-balancing? Any glaring omissions? \\n\\n2. *2022 allocation among coin types*: another question wracking my brain is how to allocate among types of crypto projects. I don't game, so I feel wholly inadequate at judging coins like Centraland or Metaverse. I'm mostly interested in smart contract applications (I guess that comes with being a lawyer!), but do folks think that leaves me topically unbalanced? Also, is it worth throwing like 5-10% of my portfolio into shitcoins?\\n\\n3.  *Long-term sale point*: The final column lists the multiplier I want to HODL until before gradually selling. The first four seem reasonably likely on a long enough time frame. Is hopium unrealistically fueling the final four projections? Any adjustments you'd make? \\n\\n| Coin  | Current portfolio    | 2022 allocation    | Net EOY 2022 | Hopeful long-term Price | Multiplier\\n|:-----------|------------:|:------------:|:------------:| :------------:| :------------:\\n| *ETH*      | 4.1% | 30% | 17.18% | $8,000 | 2.14x\\n| *ADA*      | 9.8% | 5% | 7.4% | $5 | 3.7x\\n| *DOT*     | 43.8% | 15% | 29.3% | $150 | 5.3x\\n| *SOL*      | 27.3% | 10% | 18.6% | $800| 4.6x\\n| *ATOM*      | 4.1% | 15% | 9.6% | $350| 11.6x\\n| *ONE*      | 5.2% | 15% | 10.12% | $3| 13.0x\\n| *CKB*    | 3.1% | 10% | 6.58% | $0.3| 13.3x\\n| *ALGO*      | 2.6% | 0% | 1.28% | $10| 5.8x", "links": [{"link": "https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/captain-picard-facepalm-bust/intro-import.webp).", "context": "dumb day trading.

{"title": "Bitcoin vs Bitcoin Cash, and why BCH is better in every single way", "selftext": "I see a lot of hate towards BCH which in my opinion is completely unjustified. Before I get into why BCH is good let me break down some common arguments against Bitcoin Block size being atleast 7mb.\\n\\n1. Bitcoin is digital gold/ Store of value - No, no it isn't. Bitcoin was intended to replace fiat, and act as a new form of money. It was meant to allow people to buy things safely, securely, and without censorship. If you disagree, allow me to introduce you to the title of the whitepages -   [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)\\n2. This will lead to more centralization - This is kind of true, in the argument that this reduces miners because of lower fees, however I will argue time and time again, ASIC mining is where you start if you really want to argue with centralization of mining, not block size, as block size provides much more benefit to the network.\\n3. Larger blockchain, more centralization - Storage has increased greatly in the past couple of years lessening the truth of this, and a bigger blockchain is necessary for Bitcoin to be a currency, so this is an unavoidable drawback, but one that should just be accepted.\\n\\nI invested in Crypto and joined the space out of principle, a decentralized finance system sounds better for all to me. Modern Day Bitcoin is nothing but a shitcoin in my opinion because of its lackluster tech, inefficient network, among other things. Lightning and Segwit both help lighten the damage of this 1MB block size but it doesn't scale forever and each of those are considered trying to optimize around a core issue. This approach was supported by early proponent Roger Ver and its why Bitcoin cash is much better than Bitcoin is. \\n\\nI've also heard people say use Nano for day to day and Bitcoin for long term value store, but here is my question. If Bitcoin is a value store that can't buy anything why should people value it? Storing money in NANO is better long term in that situation because atleast NANO is useful while Bitcoin is not. \\n\\nBitcoin is not scalable and nothing near a revolution, its a bloated corpse that was failed to be update and paralyzed by an Anarchical maintenance. It goes against everything Crypto is, and in my opinion is  far more overrated when compared against ETH, BCH, NANO, or other currencies which provide more to the table than it does.", "links": [{"link": "https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)\\n2.", "context": "-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)\\n2.

{"title": "REEF - Is it a scam or is it here to stay?", "selftext": " \\n\\nHey guys,\\n\\nI'm relatively new to crypto and wanted to know what this sub thinks of REEF?\\n\\nWhen I first stumbled upon the project I thought it sounded promising; an \"all in one platform\" to make DeFi a more user friendly experience.\\n\\nHowever, I have read a few posts in this sub about the operation being a potential scam? The posts are from a couple months ago and relate specifically to the .5 billion tokens being added to the supply without warning. The posts also claim there were a lot of shill accounts for this coin who were ridiculing people who were asking questions about this issue in the telegram chat.\\n\\nThe founder (Denko) has tried to clear up this issue, saying the tokens were added in order to combat market manipulation via bots?\\n\\nLastly, I also found out about a website (thanks to this sub!) called [tokensniffer.com](https://tokensniffer.com/). For those who don't know, this site allows you to check the similarity in the code between different coins and even alerts you to when the code has been copied from a 'scam coin'. I decided to check REEF out and I found it has over 88% similarity with three different projects that have all been outed as scams.\\n\\n[https://tokensniffer.com/token/0xfe3e6a25e6b192a42a44ecddcd13796471735acf](https://tokensniffer.com/token/0xfe3e6a25e6b192a42a44ecddcd13796471735acf)\\n\\nObviously REEF finance is about more than just the REEF token, however, it still seems lazy to copy so much of the code? and from scam projects? IDK. Thought I would include this as it is relevant and anyone else can have a browse if they feel like it.\\n\\nSo yeah, two months on from the coin supply scandal (and with this information above, suggesting the project to be of low quality), what are your opinions of REEF?\\n\\nDoes it have a future? Is it a flat out scam? Or perhaps it is not a scam but will just turn out as another failed project that bit off more than it could chew?\\n\\nAny discussion would be appreciated,\\n\\nThanks guys.", "links": [{"link": "https://tokensniffer.com/).", "context": "b!) called [tokensniffer.com](https://tokensniffer.com/).

{"title": "Scammed yesterday, need help getting support from Cybercrime Division.", "selftext": "hello people, just before Ethereum Merge, there were many scams running and I fell for one. I am a dickhead and thought that I was immune to such bullshit. In my case the guy was impersonating Vitalik - founder of Ethereum. He posted a fake giveaway on Twitter id u/Zidwait saying that he will give 2x Ethereum back to people who deposit ETH in his wallet. This was also the top result in Google Search as well for the whole day. \\n\\nHe had linked a site - [www.ethereum-celebration.com](https://www.ethereum-celebration.com) where he had shared his wallet address - **0x346b289363a057387d0d6b8b568abfbc82a8b0a6** where ETH had to be deposited. I deposited around 0.428 ETH and obviously didn't get anything back as I had fallen for a scam foolishly. \\n\\nI instantly reported this to Binance customer support, and they told me that they could only help me if the scammer had his wallet with Binance only, otherwise they couldn't do anything and told me to report to local law enforcement. I have already made a detailed report on [cybercrime.gov.in](https://cybercrime.gov.in) website portal with screenshots and all but I haven't got any response. I even tried to call their helpline number today, but no one picked the call. \\n\\nNow I did my own research the whole day and was able to track the scammer's transactions to a Binance wallet which I reported to Binance few hours back. They have told me that they have frozen his account, but **they cannot block it permanently and they need a request from a law enforcement to block his account** and get my money back. I provided them with below proof - \\n\\nthis is the wallet (#1) address they were using to get eth deposited - [https://etherscan.io/address/0x346b289363a057387d0d6b8b568abfbc82a8b0a6](https://etherscan.io/address/0x346b289363a057387d0d6b8b568abfbc82a8b0a6) . Check the 2nd and 3rd transactions to their new Wallet (#2) - **0xd1b7cca582578bff37faab547a4d50ff6342c6d0**. He obviously reroutes the stolen ETH across various wallets. Now see this transaction from wallet #2 to another new wallet (#3) - **0xFAA9C6676473D049FAe82D8277d1f53028FF76Ae**. Then, as can be seen @ [https://etherscan.io/address/0xfaa9c6676473d049fae82d8277d1f53028ff76ae](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfaa9c6676473d049fae82d8277d1f53028ff76ae) , he transfers all the stolen ETH from wallet #3 into his Binance wallet. As you can see this wallet is only used to transfer funds into Binance. There are no other outgoing transactions. \\n\\nFor anyone still not convinced, follow a few transactions at this link -  [Address 0xab6db7eb524e2d06c5209e21e68ba02dc501f912 | Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xab6db7eb524e2d06c5209e21e68ba02dc501f912) \\n\\nI have some other proofs for his other wallets as well, but this was the easiest to explain. From his other wallets that I saw, this person seems to have scammed to tune of almost hundreds of thousands of dollars. This is what Binance is seeking -  \\n\\n'*An official Law Enforcement request raised by a police officer through the following link* [*https://www.binance.com/en/support/law-enforcement*](https://www.binance.com/en/support/law-enforcement) *from an official email address and attaching the following:*\\n\\n*A. The photo, name, mailbox, and telephone contact of the investigating officer. B. It is necessary to issue an official document of assistance with an official seal, C. The letter should specify what information Binance needs to provide to cooperate with the investigation (such as providing account information corresponding to the 0xfaa9c6676473d049fae82d8277d1f53028ff76ae address and other involved addresses, real name information, phone number, etc.)'*\\n\\nNow, the issue is that I didn't get any support from Cybercrime portal. After researching the shit out of everything and talking with Binance support till late evening, I went to local cybercrime cell (*which I was not even sure if it existed in first place.

Here are the results.\\n\\n**Numbers &amp; assumptions:**\\n\\n* DCAing takes place every week, on 1st, 8th, 15th and 22th of every month starting from Jan 1st 2015 and until July 6th 2021.\\n* Investments budget per week is $100.\\n* The weekly investment is divided equally on the coins invested in.\\n* This case study is ignoring stable coin investments. E.g.: investing in the top 5 coins means the top 5 coins excluding any stable coins.\\n* The analysis is assuming that you invested your money and never sold any coin till now.\\n* Total invested money over the whole DCA period is $31,300.\\n* Transaction fees are not included in the analysis.\\n\\n**Here are the results:**\\n\\n* If you blindly DCA into the top 1 coins (BTC), you will end up with **$1,102,104**.\\n* If you blindly DCA into the top 2 coins, you will end up with 4 coins (BTC, XRP, LTC, ETH) in your wallet and total worth of **$1,462,443**.\\n* If you blindly DCA into the **top 3 coins**, you will end up with 11 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,310,552.**\\n* If you blindly DCA into the **top 5 coins**, you will end up with 23 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,490,189.**\\n* If you blindly DCA into the **top 7 coins**, you will end up with 37 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,923,849.**\\n* If you blindly DCA into the **top 10 coins**, you will end up with 55 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,316,169.**\\n* If you blindly DCA into the **top 20 coins**, you will end up with 130 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,619,756.**\\n* If you blindly DCA into the **top 50 coins**, you will end up with 381 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$979,086.**\\n* If you had a glass ball and knew that ETH will be what it's today and you invested only in BTC &amp; ETH, you will end up with 2 coins in your wallet (surprise), and a total worth of **$4,505,477.**\\n\\n**Some observations:**\\n\\n1. Although it was relatively easier to guess that BTC will be the #1 crypto coin back then, nobody would have guessed for sure that ETH will be #2, so betting on BTC &amp; ETH only from the beginning would've been your strategy only if you know the future. (you are God). Based on that it's safer to say \"I invest in the top X coins\" instead of saying I only invest in coin X and coin Y.\\n2. Investing in altcoins in addition to BTC can increase your ROI considerably. Investing in top 7-10 coins tends to yield the most return in this case study (x3).\\n3. Based on #2, a crypto ETF (or a similar service from exchanges that allow us to buy in bulk) could give exposure to the top X coins while saving transaction costs considerably.\\n\\nIf you want more details, here is what your wallet would look like in each case of the above:\\n\\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-aRmJBZlb9azXHODN3WFkIVzwxepH3GV/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-aRmJBZlb9azXHODN3WFkIVzwxepH3GV/view?usp=sharing), [https://drive.google.com/file/d/12v45\\_cy4hNSiEklZj042SDsgfnKObr4i/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12v45_cy4hNSiEklZj042SDsgfnKObr4i/view?usp=sharing), [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EwFvusdGrOVdagvXqAXrAw0BTUZmKowG/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EwFvusdGrOVdagvXqAXrAw0BTUZmKowG/view?usp=sharing), [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R8hZs7IYED8ksjyera37gWJLzRzcPAXE/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R8hZs7IYED8ksjyera37gWJLzRzcPAXE/view?usp=sharing), [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bRijSf8sZ9J3bIGBY-iiGAQjgbL-vPzu/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bRijSf8sZ9J3bIGBY-iiGAQjgbL-vPzu/view?usp=sharing), [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k4ONNzFqXJ96t9S2xKR8SD88VSMBXYim/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k4ONNzFqXJ96t9S2xKR8SD88VSMBXYim/view?usp=sharing), [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o\\_7Nd8TcyfkVS2-OUAvStObUjk-x4j0c/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o_7Nd8TcyfkVS2-OUAvStObUjk-x4j0c/view?usp=sharing), [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xIZv0DpMBO18LgHg-OFKo41WgHiYRFUf/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xIZv0DpMBO18LgHg-OFKo41WgHiYRFUf/view?usp=sharing), [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yGKbXeS6DZic6A1PmM5sGA2A3CZOyzUp/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yGKbXeS6DZic6A1PmM5sGA2A3CZOyzUp/view?usp=sharing)\\n\\nI**MPORTANT NOTE:** This whole case study was a fun project and i was trying to answer some questions and thought to share it with you in case that would help you in any way.

{"title": "Yield Farming FTW? A Critical View on Risks in DeFi", "selftext": "The  new focus on DeFi governance yield farming and recent  memory of Black  Thursday amplifies concerns about the poorly understood  structure of  risks in DeFi. We (researchers at Cornell and Imperial College London)  have been working on a risk-based model to help better understand the  involved risks.\\n\\nAs such, we  provide a new foundation for characterizing and modeling these risks;  this is developed in the context of stablecoins but is more widely  applicable to many crypto-economic systems, including cross-chain  protocols (think Ren, tBTC, wBTC), collateralized lending (think  Compound, Aave, dYdX), and decentralized exchanges (think Uniswap,  Curve, Balancer). Our framework focuses on measures of incentive  security, meaning that participation is mutually profitable for all  parties after accounting for attack surfaces, and economic stability,  which poses the question of whether incentives actually lead to stable  outcomes.\\n\\nWe identify an important  sustainability concern: in some DeFi systems designed with broad  governance powers and without societal recourse, the equilibrium  participation of rational agents may be zero. This is because the cost  to align incentives in these systems may be prohibitively high (an  analogy is requiring a bank to have a long-term P/E ratio of 1000 to be  secure against the theft of depositor funds). Our framework provides a  means to model these systems and yields an array of unanswered research  questions that will be critical for DeFi going forward.\\n\\nTwitter thread: [https://twitter.com/aklamun/status/1275544741086736384](https://twitter.com/aklamun/status/1275544741086736384)\\n\\nBlog post: [https://medium.com/coinmonks/stablecoins-2-0-economic-foundations-for-defi-b9ab38500b87](https://medium.com/coinmonks/stablecoins-2-0-economic-foundations-for-defi-b9ab38500b87)\\n\\nAcademic paper: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12388.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12388.pdf)", "links": [{"link": "https://twitter.com/aklamun/status/1275544741086736384](https://twitter.com/aklamun/status/1275544741086736384)\\n\\nBlog", "context": " forward.\\n\\nTwitter thread: [https://twitter.com/aklamun/status/1275544741086736384](https://twitter.com/aklamun/status/1275544741086736384)\\n\\nBlog post: [https://medium.com/coi"}, {"link": "https://medium.com/coinmonks/stablecoins-2-0-economic-foundations-for-defi-b9ab38500b87](https://medium.com/coinmonks/stablecoins-2-0-economic-foundations-for-defi-b9ab38500b87)\\n\\nAcademic", "context": "4741086736384)\\n\\nBlog post: [https://medium.com/coinmonks/stablecoins-2-0-economic-foundations-for-defi-b9ab38500b87](https://medium.com/coinmonks/stablecoins-2-0-economic-foundations-for-defi-b9ab38500b87)\\n\\nAcademic paper: [https://arxiv.org/pdf"}, {"link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12388.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12388.pdf)", "context": "38500b87)\\n\\nAcademic paper: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12388.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12388.pdf)"}]}

It?s a peer-to-peer system that enables anyone to send and receive payments anywhere. Instead of being physical money carried around and exchanged in the real world, cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries to an online database describing specific transactions. The transactions are recorded in a public ledger when you transfer cryptocurrency funds. Cryptocurrency is stored in digital wallets.\\n\\nCryptocurrency received its name because it uses encryption to verify transactions. This means advanced coding is involved in storing and transmitting cryptocurrency data between wallets and public ledgers. The aim of encryption is to provide security and safety.\\n\\nThe first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, founded in 2009,d is the best known today. Much of the interest in cryptocurrencies is to trade for profit, with speculators at times driving prices skyward.

{"title": "We Are Building a Truly Decentralized Investment Platform and Would Love to Hear Your Feedback", "selftext": " \\n\\nHi everyone, My name is Kevin, I?m the co-founder at [DeStreet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wiser.app), where we are building a truly decentralized investment platform that is borderless, safe, secure while remaining easy to use for mainstream users. We would like to hear your feedback on our project!\\n\\nCurrent solutions are either centralized,  while putting a lot of restrictions on the users (quite ironic when you preach decentralization!) and pose custodial risks and many defi projects are built for crypto natives with a multitude of steps that makes things too complicated for a mainstream user. \\n\\nRight now, on DeStreet, you can purchase coins that are on the polygon network. We have integrated  DEX aggregator 1inch ([https://1inch.io/aggregation-protocol/](https://1inch.io/aggregation-protocol/)) to get you the best prices.\\n\\n**Onboarding**\\n\\nWe don?t do any KYC since we are not a crypto exchange, only a platform.\\n\\nSo our onboarding is very quick, takes less than 2 minutes. Just enter your email, you will receive an OTP and you are good to go.\\n\\n**Key Management:**\\n\\nAs soon as you sign up, we generate a wallet for you. We use [Magic](https://magic.link/) (formerly, Fortmatic) for authentication and wallet recovery (no more seed phrases!). Your wallet is linked to your email and you can recover it anytime you want.\\n\\nWe are fully non-custodial, so neither us nor Magic can ever see your keys. You are free to transfer your coins without any limitations (we can?t suspend withdrawals during a crash even if we want to XD)\\n\\nMagic?s delegated key management system uses AWS KMS to store your keys in Hardware Security Modules (HSMs), which work similar to hardware wallets like Ledger, Trezor etc. All encryption and decryption operations happen inside the HSMs themselves, so an attacker can?t just leak your encrypted keys to the world and hope to brute force it. \\n\\nYou can read Magic?s whitepaper here: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/3flqaszoigwis5b/Magic%20Whitepaper.pdf?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3flqaszoigwis5b/Magic%20Whitepaper.pdf?dl=0)\\n\\n**Buy using INR**\\n\\nFor Indian users, we have partnered with OnMeta for fiat on-ramps. It is well integrated within our platform so the user experience is much better and your don?t have to deal with any p2p scams.\\n\\nIf you are outside India you can use Transak for fiat conversion. It is also integrated within our platform. \\n\\n**Fees:**\\n\\nWe don?t charge any trading fee. Though you will have to pay the polygon network (gas) fee, which currently is hovering around Rs.1- 2 per trade. However, 1inch will charge a trade fee based on the DEXes it uses for your trade (the rates are lower or similar to most centralized exchanges depending on the pair)\\n\\n**Transfer**\\n\\nThere won?t be any limitation in transferring coins to or from our platform. Since we are only a platform, we don?t facilitate fiat withdrawals. Onmeta is working on this, so hopefully it will be available soon.

{"title": "Crypto is FAST- Here's Why That Matters", "selftext": " \\n\\nCryptocurrency has a lot of benefits over traditional payment mechanisms. It is decentralized, and it has an algorithmically determined money supply that leads to a stable currency. Those are all very important benefits, but to the everyday user, they might seem a little bit abstract. The everyday user just wants a simple, fast, effective payment mechanism to use without hassle. In this article, I wanted to take a little bit of time and discuss one of the **more tangible benefits of cryptocurrency usage for normal, everyday users - the quick payment settling speed.**\\n\\n**Slow Speeds Create Disagreement**\\n\\nWith traditional payment methods, such as credit cards, it can take anywhere from 24 hours to three days for funds to move from one person's bank account to another person's bank account. Obviously, this can create confusion and disagreement if one person thinks they have paid for something but the other person has not yet received funds in their bank account.\\n\\nImagine for a moment that you pay for a airplane flight, hotel reservation, or bus ticket with your credit card on Tuesday night. When you show up on Wednesday for your hotel or flight, the business owner politely notifies you that you will need to pay them since they have not yet received anything from your account. Both parties believe that they are in the right. If you paid with your credit card on a Tuesday night, you could easily look at your bank account and see that you had pending charges. At the same time, the merchants would not yet have any payment received in their account. Even though both parties have the best of intentions, the length of time that it takes to settle this payment can cause disagreement and cause both parties to suspect each other of wrongdoing. The merchant would think that the customer is trying to avoid paying , and the customer would think that the merchant is trying to double charge them.\u00c2\u00a0\\n\\n**Crypto Provides Speed and Certainty**\\n\\nNow, instead of paying with credit cards, let's suppose that we were paying with the USDC stablecoin or the Dai stablecoin. These are both cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of $1 and are exchanged on the Ethereum network. According to eth gas station, it currently takes about 19 cents to make a transfer that will process and settle in about 2 minutes. Remember that the average credit card charge takes between 24 hours and 3 days to settle. Even if we give credit cards the benefit of the doubt and assume that every transfer happens at the fast end of that spectrum and completes in 24 hours, that still means that transferring USDC or Dai is over 720x faster.\\n\\nThis fast transfer speed is important because it gives both parties the confirmation that payment has been tendered and payment has also been received. Perhaps even more importantly, this record of transfer is publicly available in an immutable blockchain that can be reviewed and consulted in case there is ever a discrepancy on whether somebody actually paid or not.\\n\\nCryptocurrency offers a whole host of benefits over traditional payment methods, but even if we discount the importance of decentralization or censorship resistance, cryptocurrency can still offer many improvements over traditional payment methods. The long delay that it takes to process pending charges via traditional credit card can be a source of confusion and disagreement between merchants and customers. The ability to conduct near-instantaneous transfers and settle payments quickly is just one more actual use case that will make crypto the money of the future.\\n\\n**References**\\n\\n[CreditCardProcessing.com](https://www.creditcardprocessing.com/2013/12/long-take-merchant-receive-funds/)\\n\\n[Eth Gas Station](https://www.ethgasstation.info/)\\n\\nImage Credit\\n\\n[https://unsplash.com/@sortino](https://unsplash.com/@sortino)", "links": [{"link": "https://www.creditcardprocessing.com/2013/12/long-take-merchant-receive-funds/)\\n\\n[Eth", "context": "n\\n[CreditCardProcessing.com](https://www.creditcardprocessing.com/2013/12/long-take-merchant-receive-funds/)\\n\\n[Eth Gas Station](https://www.ethg"}, {"link": "https://www.ethgasstation.info/)\\n\\nImage", "context": "-funds/)\\n\\n[Eth Gas Station](https://www.ethgasstation.info/)\\n\\nImage Credit\\n\\n[https://unsplash.c"}, {"link": "https://unsplash.com/@sortino](https://unsplash.com/@sortino)", "context": "on.info/)\\n\\nImage Credit\\n\\n[https://unsplash.com/@sortino](https://unsplash.com/@sortino)"}]}

History tells us that the 200 Week SMA is where Bitcoin Bottoms Out. Hence, the first reason is the 200 Week SMA and our price target is $14,000.\\n\\nSecondly, on the Bitcoin 6 Months chart, we see that we have closed the last candle about 5 days back and it was a shooting star candle. Shooting star candlesticks are found at the top of an uptrend. This indicates that we might be in a correction phase for the the next 1 to 2 candles which is about 6 to 12 months. On inspecting the first level of support on this chart we see that it is down to $14,000 which becomes our price target.\\n\\nLastly, on the Bitcoin 5 days chart, we plot the Gaussian Channel. History tells us that when ever we go below the bottom line of the Gaussian Channel, we tend to correct by approximately 50%. Therefore, a 50% correction from the current bottom of the Gaussian Channel takes us to about $14,000.", "links": [{"link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swm9oPml-u8)\\n\\nFirstly,", "context": "Bitcoin Can go Below $20,000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swm9oPml-u8)\\n\\nFirstly, on the Bitcoin Weekly Chart, "}]}

The transactions are recorded in a public ledger when you transfer cryptocurrency funds.

{"title": "An open discussion on EIP-1559", "selftext": "I?m curious what people think about EIP-1559. You can find a good explanation of the proposal [here.](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/ethereum-improvement-proposal-ETH-gas-fee)\\n\\nThis, along with ETH 2.0 and drastic reduction of block rewards is why I?m so bullish on ETH. \\n\\nEIP-1559 is very controversial however. Here?s a TL;DR on Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559\\n\\n- The current auction-based fee system that a lot of other popular coins use will potentially be done away with. \\n\\n- Users will pay a static fee with the option of a tip. The fee will be burned (removes ETH from circulation) and the tips will go to the miners. \\n\\n- The goal is to fill half the block with standard transactions and the other half with tipped transactions. \\n\\n- The base fee will increase and decrease. If all available transactions will fill 50% or the block the base fee rises. If they fill less than 50% of the block the fee falls. \\n\\n- The tip is a way to ensure you?re in the next block. This bit is the controversial part to me. It?s removing an auction system but keeping an auction system for 50% of a block. \\n\\n- Flexible block sizes are on the table. \\n\\n- This promises to DRASTICALLY reduce the fees for ETH transactions and start to deflate ETH by burning the base fees. This is good for upward price movement. \\n\\n\\nI am a miner (albeit not as big as I was when I had 36 1070s mining in 2017) and I?m all for this EIP. Bigger miners aren?t as big a fan. They see fees being burned and issuance being cut and they?re nervous. \\n\\nI feel like this will be moot when ETH 2.0 merges with ETH. ETH 2.0 is live right now and is dubbed The Beacon Chain. Soon (hopefully end of 2021) ETH as it stands today will be added to ETH 2.0\\nas a shard of the Beacon Chain. More elaborate sharding capabilities will go live in 2022. \\n\\n\\nOverall I think EIP-1559 is a nice addition to the move to staking vs mining. Reducing supply of ETH will promote upward price movement and take a ton of stress off the ETH network, where fees are incredibly high right now. \\n\\nWhat do you all think? I?m curious about the community?s thoughts about not only 1559 but how the network will respond to the end of GPU mining of ETH. \\n\\nAt minimum us gamers are finally going to be able to buy GPUs to game without having to sell a kidney to afford one :) \\n\\nETH?s future is bright! \\n\\nFull disclosure - right now about 70% of my portfolio is in ETH and ETH 2.0 staking. I?ve been in crypto since late 2011. \\n\\nCheers all!", "links": [{"link": "https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/ethereum-improvement-proposal-ETH-gas-fee)\\n\\nThis,", "context": "ation of the proposal [here.](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/ethereum-improvement-proposal-ETH-gas-fee)\\n\\nThis, along with ETH 2.0 and drasti"}]}

{"title": "Using a per transaction metric to talk about bitcoin energy use is disingenuous and intellectually lazy. Here's Why:", "selftext": " The \"PER transaction\" carbon, electricity and e-waste metric is such a deceitful metric. Anyone who uses it is willful ignoring that:  \\n\\n* there are several other chains that are merge mined with the same hashpower as bitcoin (Syscoin is one of the biggest).  So does syscoin have zero carbon responsibility because it uses BTC's hash in merge mining ?  The authors of such metrics would like us to believe so.   \\n\\n* There are hundreds of thousand of transactions that take place on the Lightening network.  Why are the authors of these \"per transaction\" metrics willfully ignoring all the activity on the Lightening network ?  Is it because they are to lazy to actually figure out how many transactions are taking place ? Or are they trying to push an agenda.   Besides lightening network, there are other layer 2 networks, like liquid.  Where thousands of transactions take place.  \\n\\n* The current hashpower secures ALL PAST transactions.  The current hashpower isnt just used to write the current transactions in a block, but its used to secure every single previous transaction in bitcoins history.   \\n\\n* The block reward is more than just a normal transaction.\\n\\n The block reward can be considered as a kind of battery whereby the electricity used to make hashes is transformed into a more easily kept and stored unit.  In a way,  these newly created bitcoin can be considered as a form of stored electricity.  The electricity used to create those bitcoins gets transformed into unit of accounts.  These units then can be transformed back into electricity via purchasing power that the BTC units have.  Or even more literally, they can be used to hire mechanical work from humans or other machines (using BTC to rent a generator that produces energy, or renting a solar array to charge a battery).  So figuratively the block reward acts as a sort of battery.  The energy isn't \"wasted\"  its merely transformed into units that can be more easily stored over time and sent across the planet.  \\n\\nThe bitcoin energy usage discussion is a very nuanced one, and it's very intellectually lazy to try to use comparisons of \"per transaction\".  Lets look at GPU gaming.  It uses more electricity than the bitcoin network, but it doesnt generate units of account that can be used forever (or as long the BTC network exists).  It just generates fun (at the time) and perhaps some fond memories.  Or take a look at x-mas trees lights (https://phys.org/news/2015-12-christmas-energy-entire-countries.html)  They can be considered not very useful in that they only provide ascetically pleasing lights for a tiny period, yet consume the amount of energy as small countries.  But again, bitcoin energy is transformed into units of account that can be used for as long as the network exists.  \\n\\nUsing a per tx metric to talk about bitcoin energy use is disingenuous and intellectually lazy.

PayPal, Visa, most of these companies will support transactions in ETH. Goods, services can be bought with ETH. ETH stabilizes (at a high price), with minor fluctuations similar to how a currency would fluctuate.\\n\\n# Bitcoin still remains useful, literally as a store of value like gold\\n\\nBitcoin literally becomes like Digital Gold, the way it is meant to be. 1 BTC could be worth $500k like what Cathie Wood predicts, or even more.

My interest is in upskilling people to resist this type of thing in every context, not specifically relating to crypto, but I'm hoping that here is somewhere it can actually to demonstrable good to help people protect themselves from scams and financial disinformation. Feel free to share this wherever and whenever you like.\\n\\nHere's some sites you can use to check up on other users before deciding how much weight to give their professed opinion:\\n\\nhttps://reddit-user-analyser.netlify.app/ - The simplest and fastest user analysis tool that I use. It provides a list of the top 100 subreddits a user has posted in and their most commonly used 100 words, excluding articles (the/a) and prepositions (in/on/etc.) I think. There are also graphs of their comments and submissions by date.\\n\\nYou can use this information to identify users who bolster their reputation in karma farming subs; potential shills who are likely to be biased in their 'advice'; trolls who are just trying to cause disruption etc etc.\\n\\n\\nhttps://redditmetis.com/ - Is another site that analyzes a user, similar to reddit-user-analyser but in addition to displaying where and when they post and get karma it also will actually use their posts to extract information they have stated about themselves such as their employment, nationality etc. This shouldn't be taken as completely reliable as not only can it make mistakes but it also has no way of knowing if a user has lied. Some information has a # link next to it which leads you to the comment from which the information was extracted, this lets you consider context and judge it's veracity for yourself.\\n\\nAnother great feature of redditmetis is the activity heatmap, showing when in the day a user posts. If they claim to be from Canada but they only post in working hours Moscow time then that may raise a red flag...\\n\\n\\nhttps://www.redditinvestigator.com/ - Similar to the first two however much slower to generate the analysis. I'd suggest giving it a try, although I use it much less than the others. The one unique feature is that it extracts the website links used in submissions to show you if the user frequently links to certain sites. In the context of crypto, if someone is constantly shilling their shitcoin you might expect to see a high frequency of links to the coin's ICO for example.\\n\\n\\n\\nhttps://camas.github.io/reddit-search/ - This site lets you search all comments a user has made on a certain sub, within a certain timeframe and/or including keywords. If you wanted to find all the posts made by account X in r/cryptocurrency that included their shillcoin Y you could do so. Similarly if someone is trying to drive down interest in a competing project you might search for terms like 'Overpriced' or 'Shitcoin' and see how often they sue those in association with their opponent.\\n\\nhttps://redditcommentsearch.com/ - Does similar to the above but with less search options. No fields to limit date range for example, but otherwise perfectly useful. Sometimes simplicity is good.\\n\\n\\n\\nhttps://www.reveddit.com/ and https://www.removeddit.com/ - Both of these sites allow you to view deleted comments from discussions, assuming that the comments wasn't removed too quickly. You'll often see users arguing in what appears to be bad faith, spreading disinformation about projects or lying to hype something up. When someone disproves their bullshit or calls them out the bad-faith user may delete their comments, so when they try something similar again no-one can see that they shouldn't be trusted.\\n\\nEither of these sites provide you with a counter to these reputation management techniques, allowing you to view and share evidence of previous manipulation attempts that the user may think they have scrubbed from the record.\\n\\n\\nAs per the cryptocurrency mantra - **Don't trust, verify.**", "links": [{"link": "https://reddit-user-analyser.netlify.app/", "context": "e their professed opinion:\\n\\nhttps://reddit-user-analyser.netlify.app/ - The simplest and fastest us"}, {"link": "https://redditmetis.com/", "context": "ause disruption etc etc.\\n\\n\\nhttps://redditmetis.com/ - Is another site that analyz"}, {"link": "https://www.redditinvestigator.com/", "context": " may raise a red flag...\\n\\n\\nhttps://www.redditinvestigator.com/ - Similar to the first two ho"}, {"link": "https://camas.github.io/reddit-search/", "context": "oin's ICO for example.\\n\\n\\n\\nhttps://camas.github.io/reddit-search/ - This site lets you search a"}, {"link": "https://redditcommentsearch.com/", "context": "ation with their opponent.\\n\\nhttps://redditcommentsearch.com/ - Does similar to the above b"}, {"link": "https://www.reveddit.com/", "context": "es simplicity is good.\\n\\n\\n\\nhttps://www.reveddit.com/ and https://www.removeddit.co"}, {"link": "https://www.removeddit.com/", "context": "https://www.reveddit.com/ and https://www.removeddit.com/ - Both of these sites allow y"}]}

It's possible, however imho after 2 different dog-themed pumps, I have a feeling people will want to latch onto something newer and fresher than another dog.\\n\\nI've also seen reference to switching over to a cat-themed meme. Pussy is the coin I've seen referenced the most. However my marketing background says a coin with that name is going to struggle to make larger headlines.\\n\\nWhich comes to Dogelon Mars (ELON). It's already on a mini bull run over the last couple days. It's not just another dog, it's named after a narcissist who was just named [Richest Person In History](https://www.forbes.com/video/6279060530001/elon-musk-is-the-richest-person-in-history/), who if he got wind of a coin pumping that was named after him... could just tweet about it and start the rocket that takes ELON to ~~the moon~~ MARS.

I can see in the future games like GTA with NFT cars and weapons and even clothes. That would revolutionize gaming. Maybe an RPG games with player based economies with different professions and loot that is all NFT ([Albino Vs Wallstreet](https://www.albinosvswallstreet.com/) looks like a promising one).

[https://i.imgur.com/Uohvbcp.png](https://i.imgur.com/Uohvbcp.png) you can even see here that just before the dump 83% of people on bitfinex were long which is a massive downward selling pressure if the market was able to dip low enough to stop people out.The take away is things like bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies will almost never take off as a currency when we created things like 100x leveraged longs and shorts.

{"title": "Investing in crypto safer way.", "selftext": " \\n\\nHello fellow crypto comrade!\\n\\nThe most important quality for investing(in anything) IMHO is: - **Patience** (the ability to wait for a long time without becoming annoyed or upset) meaning buying and HODLing.\\n\\nIt might be hard to go through bear market, but it is the bear **not the bull** that makes you rich.\\n\\n**What not to do**: FOMO, panic sell on FUD, day trade or overtrade, chasing the pumps, you will lose money 99% of the time.\\n\\nAvoid greed, it will ruin you. Avoid showing off your gains (scammers love bragging idiots), be modest. Remember 3x is already a good profit.\\n\\nWhat to do: be **PATIENT**, understand what it is that you are buying, understand the risks, buy the dips or at accumulation zones, take some profits if coin moons. Take calculated risks. Crypto is volatile and that is good, when everybody is panic selling, you **panic buy the dip**.\\n\\nFollow the brains, where all the smart people are going? It is not likely that you can predict crypto market moves short term, so **Cost Averaging** is the best strategy for accumulation.\\n\\nStore using hard wallet, I use both Trezor &amp; Ledger.\\n\\nHave FIAT on the side, do not go ALL IN, it is stupid. **Think ahead**.\\n\\n**Types of crypto:**\\n\\n1. **BITCOIN** \\- buy and HOLD, sell only if there is **absolutely** nothing else left to do (shitstorm crisis). Bitcoin is absolutely precious and rare, never sell your bitcoin ever. Maybe only to save a life or prevent nuclear alien invasion apocalypses biological war. 75 - 90% of the portfolio. Lowest risk, life changing asset.\\n2. **Ethereum** \\- Long term hold, maybe take some profits, to return the initial investment, hold 1 to 3 years, then decide. 10 - 20% of the portfolio. Low risk.\\n3. **Alt** coins (top 100 by market capitalization) research, buy, hold, sell for gains (in US it is good to hold for a year for tax reasons [https://tokentax.co/help/cryptocurrency-tax-rates/](https://tokentax.co/help/cryptocurrency-tax-rates/)). 5 - 10% of portfolio just in case. Medium risk.\\n4. SHIT coins, low cap coins - High risk stuff, you will lose money 9 times out of 10, nether the less that ONE hidden gem shit coin hopium can cover all the losses and take away the pain, and then make you rich as fuck. Maybe risk 1% of portfolio. Have fun gambling. High or Highest risk. Never works.\\n\\n**Tools to use for research:**\\n\\n* Crypto Fear &amp; Greed Index [https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/)\\n* Bitcoin altcoin season [https://www.blockchaincenter.net/altcoin-season-index/](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/altcoin-season-index/)\\n* Also READ some books on the subject. Understand mass psychology, herd behavior, propaganda manipulation. Markets are made of people and humans are pack animals.\\n* Coin market cap [https://coinmarketcap.com/](https://coinmarketcap.com/) look at the coin's rating, trading volume, historical chart.\\n* DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH, there is a ton of people who will tell you to buy some shit coin, only to disappear as soon as it dumps.\\n\\n**Buying crypto:**\\n\\nI use pro.[coinbase.com](https://coinbase.com/) as an onramp to load and unload fiat in USA . For alt coins that I can not buy on coinbase pro I use [kraken](https://craken.com/).com or binance and trade with USDC. Also have accounts on a number of other exchanges(offshore) just in case.\\n\\nThis is based on my own experience being a long term investor in crypto. I am not a financial advisor, I just love my coins. Hope it will be of use 8)\\n\\nThank you for reading.\\n\\nHope it helps you not to get ruined in this volatile market.
